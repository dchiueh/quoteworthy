      "original_text": "The former Army Ranger was to take a high-profile role prosecuting House Democrats’ case against President Trump in the Senate trial. WASHINGTON — As a former Army Ranger who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, Representative Jason Crow, who flipped a Republican-held seat in 2018, has quickly emerged in the Democratic caucus as a leading voice on national security. Drawing on those credentials and his experience as a litigator, Speaker Nancy Pelosi named the Colorado Democrat as an impeachment manager on Wednesday, selecting him as part of the team of lawmakers who will play a high-profile role prosecuting House Democrats’ case against President Trump in the Senate trial. Mr. Crow is a first-term lawmaker — one of only two among a seven-person manager team — and he does not serve on any of the committees that have been leading the impeachment inquiry. So his selection to play a high-profile role in the impeachment trial underscores the crucial role national security-minded freshmen have played in the House investigation. Mr. Crow was among a group of seven freshmen from conservative-leaning districts — all veterans or former intelligence analysts — who wrote an op-ed urging Congress to impeach Mr. Trump if the allegations were true that he withheld military aid to Ukraine as part of an attempt to get the country to investigate his political rivals. The piece was seen by many as a crucial development that encouraged Democratic lawmakers by indicating they had enough backing — including among their politically vulnerable colleagues — to press ahead and open an inquiry into the president. “He allegedly sought to use the very security assistance dollars appropriated by Congress to create stability in the world, to help root out corruption and to protect our national security interests, for his own personal gain,” Mr. Crow and his colleagues wrote. “These allegations are stunning, both in the national security threat they pose and the potential corruption they represent.” While Mr. Crow is best known for his advocacy on gun safety measures and his service in the Army, where he was honored with the Bronze Star, he worked as a litigator after his tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, specializing in white-collar defense and government investigations. He has since emerged as one of the most outspoken freshmen from a swing district urging the House to take on Mr. Trump. “If Congress doesn’t stand up to these abuses, then our system of checks and balances will have failed,” Mr. Crow said shortly after announcing he would support the impeachment inquiry. “It’s clear that we must respond with the full weight of Congress.” PHOTO",

Speaking in Paris on Tuesday, Bruno Le Maire, the French finance minister, said that he had spoken on Monday with Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, about a new French tax on Facebook, Google and other American technology giants. The tax has angered the Trump administration and prompted the United States to propose a range of retaliatory levies on French goods. Mr. Le Maire said he and Mr. Mnuchin would redouble their efforts to find a compromise before their meeting this month on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, where they will be joined by United States trade representative, Robert Lighthizer. “I made it clear to Steven Mnuchin that as long as we are discussing, as long as we are negotiating, there could not be any American sanctions,” Mr. Le Maire said, according to an English translation of his comments provided by the French Embassy. Efforts to reach a resolution came as representatives from a variety of industries that could be hit by tariffs gathered in Washington to argue against the administration’s plan. Executives from industries including handbags, cookware, porcelain, champagne and cheese described the prospect of American tariffs of up to 100 percent on French imports as a threat for their businesses and begged to be exempt. “How can you just gut my family business?” Mary Taylor, the founder of a company that brings European wines to the American market, asked a panel of government officials in a hearing room south of the Capitol. “I’ve read about farmer subsidies. Will my family be subsidized?” “Never could I imagine my business would be threatened like this from the federal government,” Ms. Taylor added. “What do digital services have to do with European wine? Nothing.” The Trump administration has turned to tariffs as a source of leverage in trade negotiations and other diplomatic matters. The threat of painful levies has coaxed China, Mexico, Canada and other countries into signing trade agreements with the United States, but the Trump administration has yet to make much progress negotiating new trade terms with Europe. Instead, the trans-Atlantic trade relationship has become increasingly strained, with Mr. Trump criticizing the European Union for running a trade surplus with the United States and accusing it of being “worse than China” in its trade practices. In November, the Trump administration stepped away from a major escalation in relations as it quietly allowed a deadline to impose tariffs on European cars to expire. But it has moved ahead with other tariffs on European products — some in response to a dispute over aircraft at the World Trade Organization, and others in response to France’s new tax on digital services. Like other European countries, France has long been frustrated that platforms like Google, Facebook and Amazon have large digital presences and conduct a lot of commerce in their country, but pay few taxes because they have little physical presence there. In July, France passed into law a 3 percent tax on the revenue some companies earn from providing digital services to French users. American officials have called the tax “discriminatory” and “unreasonable” and detailed a plan to retaliate by imposing tariffs on porcelain, soap, handbags, wine, yogurt, lipstick and other French products, though they have not specified the rate or total dollar value of the tariffs that might be imposed. A spokesman for the United States trade representative said the administration was now considering duties of up to 100 percent on certain French products, as well as fees or restrictions on French services, commensurate with the level of harm to the American economy that results from the tax. A Treasury spokesman declined to comment. International negotiators have been trying to head off such conflicts by developing a broader framework for digital taxes. Negotiations are continuing at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, but the slow pace of the talks has frustrated European officials. On Tuesday, Mr. Le Maire met with Phil Hogan, the new European trade commissioner, who will travel to the United States next week to discuss how to respond to potential American tariffs. If no deal is struck at the O.E.C.D. and American tariffs are imposed, France has vowed to retaliate with its own levies, as well as call on the European Union to move ahead with a broader European project for digital taxation. Mr. Le Maire said that if the United States imposed tariffs during the negotiating period it would effectively end the talks. He added that other European countries were in the process of establishing similar taxes, with about 15 countries around the world planning to impose their own national digital tax by June. “If the Americans start to hit France with sanctions because it has introduced national digital taxes, it will have to go tomorrow to also hit Italy, Austria, Great Britain,” Mr. Le Maire said. “We will enter a commercial conflict between the United States and Europe.” Mr. Trump and many of his supporters have argued that tariffs on foreign goods do not have much effect on American companies, and have largely dismissed complaints like those shared at Tuesday’s hearing. Other officials have acknowledged that the tariffs impose some costs on American businesses, but have argued the price is worth it to secure other changes. The businesses that are paying the levies have protested, and loudly. Ms. Taylor, the wine expert, said she had woken up at 2 a.m. that day to get to Washington, and insisted on testifying before the panel disbanded early, before an afternoon snowstorm. Her passionate testimony was followed by cheers and applause from dozens of wine merchants in the audience of a normally staid hearing room. Other executives complained Tuesday that the tariffs would cause them to put the brakes on hiring or expansion plans, and could force their businesses to close altogether. Faye Gooding, the recently retired chief executive of Le Creuset of America, called the tariff “an existential threat” to the company’s existence in South Carolina. Le Creuset’s candy-colored Dutch ovens — which feature prominently on many American wedding registries — are manufactured in France. But the company employs more people in warehouses and retail locations in the United States than in any other country, Ms. Gooding said. A tariff of up to 100 percent on the company’s premium cookware could prove catastrophic for its about 900 American employees, including around 300 in South Carolina, she said. Benjamin Aneff, the managing partner of Tribeca Wine Merchants, called the prospect of a tax on French wine and champagne the “greatest threat to the industry since Prohibition.” Even if wines originate in France, they are typically sold in the United States by American distributors and retailers, businesses that would be hurt by higher taxes, he said. Nate Herman, the vice president of international trade at the American Apparel & Footwear Association, which represents makers of handbags that would be hit by the tariffs, said that his members had been “baffled” at becoming embroiled in a digital sales tax dispute. The industry agrees with the government’s objective of eliminating the digital services tax, he said. “We just don’t agree with the U.S. government’s proposal to accomplish that goal — imposing taxes on handbags.” Liz Alderman contributed reporting from Paris.

      "original_text": "The budget gap widened despite a growing economy, hitting its highest level since 2012. WASHINGTON — The federal budget deficit surpassed $1 trillion in 2019, the Treasury Department reported on Monday, as tax cuts and spending increases continued to force heavy government borrowing amid a record-long economic expansion. The deficit grew by 17 percent from 2018 to 2019, the Treasury data shows. That was a slowdown from the 28 percent growth in 2018, the first year President Trump’s signature tax cuts were in full effect. Last year’s deficit would have been even larger if not for a series of interest-rate cuts undertaken in 2019 by the Federal Reserve, which helped to push the cost of new government debt down. It was the first calendar year since 2012 that the deficit topped $1 trillion. Deficits swelled after the 2008 financial crisis, as lawmakers cut taxes and increased spending in an effort to revive growth. The gap had narrowed through 2015 under a budget agreement between President Barack Obama and Republicans in Congress, which reined in federal spending. The widening deficit under Mr. Trump shows the degree to which economic growth on his watch has been helped by fiscal stimulus — increased borrowing by the government that injects more money into the consumer economy. That combination is unusual for a growing economy with low unemployment. In recent periods in the United States, sustained economic expansions have brought deficits down. A wave of retirements by baby boomers has begun to put pressure on the deficit by helping to drive up annual spending on Social Security and Medicare. But Mr. Trump has increased that pressure by signing both a $1.5 trillion tax-cut package in late 2017, which reduced federal tax revenue, and a series of bipartisan congressional agreements to increase spending on the military and on nondefense domestic programs like education. Total federal receipts rose by 5 percent in 2019, after falling slightly in 2018 after the tax cuts. It was the fastest rate of growth for tax receipts since 2015, but still well below several years of receipts growth recorded under Mr. Obama. Spending grew by 7.5 percent in 2019, the fastest rate since 2009. Mr. Trump promised to balance the budget and constrain federal spending as a candidate in the 2016 presidential election, and at one point he said he could pay off the entire federal debt in eight years. He and other Republicans have long criticized Democrats, particularly Mr. Obama, for spending too much and running up the deficit. In pushing for the tax cuts, Mr. Trump and his allies promised they would generate enough growth to “pay for themselves” through economic growth that generated additional tax revenues. The Treasury Department data released on Monday shows how far Mr. Trump has fallen short of each of those promises. Tax revenues remain hundreds of billions of dollars below where the Congressional Budget Office predicted they would be before the tax-cut package was signed, while spending is accelerating at roughly the same pace as those 2017 projections. In the three years Mr. Trump has been president, federal revenues have increased by an average of 2.6 percent per year. Spending has increased by 5.7 percent per year, and the deficit has grown by 20.8 percent per year. Under Mr. Obama, receipts grew significantly faster, at an average of 3.9 percent per year. Spending grew at less than half the average annual rate than it has under Mr. Trump. The deficit has grown nearly four times as fast, on average, under Mr. Trump than it did under Mr. Obama. Mr. Trump has already added more to the national debt than Mr. Obama did in his entire second term — $2.6 trillion, compared with Mr. Obama’s $2.1 trillion.

MEXICO CITY — The body of a Mexican conservationist devoted to the protection of the monarch butterfly in Mexico was found on Wednesday, two weeks after he went missing, the authorities said. The conservationist, Homero Gómez González, managed a butterfly sanctuary in the state of Michoacán, a violence-ravaged region that is also the location of mountain forests where the butterflies settle every winter after a long and extraordinary migration from Canada and the United States. Mr. Gómez’s disappearance was reported on Jan. 14, spurring a robust search involving several government agencies. The circumstances of his disappearance and death remain unclear, though an official with Michoacán’s human rights commission told Reuters in the days after he vanished that he might have run afoul of illegal loggers working in the area. Criminal groups in Mexico and elsewhere in Latin America have often threatened or attacked environmentalists whose work impedes their interests. In recent years, Mexico has been reeling from a relentless increase in homicides, a trend that President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has been unable to reverse in the 14 months he has been in office. Last year, the nation recorded more than 34,500 murders, the highest annual tally since the late 1990s when the government started keeping such data. Mr. Gómez’s body was found in the municipality of Ocampo in northeastern Michoacán, where he had disappeared, in a large tank designed to capture rainwater, said Magdalena Guzmán, a spokeswoman for the state prosecutor’s office in Michoacán. Investigators had not yet determined a cause of death, she said in an interview late Wednesday. The disappearance of Mr. Gómez struck Mexico particularly hard, in part because he had devoted himself to the protection of an iconic and widely loved feature of the country’s natural environment. Millions of the orange-and-black monarch butterflies arrive in Mexico starting in October after flying as far as 3,000 miles from the eastern regions of the United States and Canada. They make the return trip in March. The monarch is the only species of butterfly known to make a two-way migration akin to the round-trip migration of birds, according to the United States Forest Service. In Mexico, the monarchs settle in about a dozen high-altitude, fir-covered mountainous areas in Michoacán and contiguous Mexico State, the Forest Service said. But those habitats have been threatened for years by illegal logging, which has contributed to a decline in their population. Mr. Gómez worked at a sanctuary called El Rosario, in the Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve, a site on the UNESCO World Heritage List that is a popular destination for tourists wanting to see the butterflies. “The overwintering concentration of butterflies in the property is a superlative natural phenomenon,” the UNESCO website says. “The millions of monarch butterflies that return to the property every year bend tree branches by their weight, fill the sky when they take flight, and make a sound like light rain with the beating of their wings. Witnessing this unique phenomenon is an exceptional experience of nature.” The Purépecha, an Indigenous population that primarily lives in Michoacán, consider the monarch butterfly “the soul of the dead,” according to the Mexican government, and view the butterflies’ arrival as the harbinger of the Day of the Dead, an annual celebration of friends and family who have died.

      "original_text": "Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming said Republicans are ready to vote for a final judgment as early as Friday. Republican leaders signaled they were regaining confidence on Wednesday that they would be able to block new witnesses and documents and bring the trial to an acquittal verdict as soon as Friday, after revelations from John R. Bolton threatened to knock their plans off course. Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming, the No. 3 Senate Republican, told reporters that if they were successful in holding off new witnesses, Republicans planned to move directly to a vote on the two articles of impeachment themselves. “Yes, that’s the plan,” he told reporters in the Capitol. It was unclear if there would be additional closing arguments, or if the Senate would vote up or down on the abuse of power and obstruction charges Friday evening. “I’ve heard enough,” Mr. Barrasso said. “I’m ready to vote on final judgment. This has been fully partisan, fully political.” Mr. Barrasso’s prediction came as Republican senators appeared to be falling into line to block witnesses a day after Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, warned them privately that he did not currently have the votes to stop Democrats from calling them. Senator Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania, who earlier in the week expressed some support for a witness deal, said Wednesday that he was now unlikely to be a yes. “I remain very very skeptical that there is any witness” that I would vote to hear from, Mr. Toomey told reporters in the Capitol. Senator Cory Gardner of Colorado, who is seeking re-election this year in a politically competitive state, also told Colorado Politics that he had heard enough and would vote against hearing from more witnesses. Senator Mitt Romney of Utah maintained that he would vote in favor of witnesses and documents, but said he was uncertain how many Republicans would join him. “I’m sure there’ll be others,” he said. “How many there will be on my side of the aisle, I just don’t know.” PHOTO: “I’m ready to vote on final judgment. This has been fully partisan, fully political,” said Senator John Barrasso, Republican of Wyoming.

      "original_text": "Even before the California utility said it had an accord with bondholders, Gov. Gavin Newsom declared that the plan didn’t meet the public interest. Pacific Gas & Electric, the giant California utility, said Wednesday that it had resolved differences with its creditors over how to restructure the company, clearing one of the last major hurdles to its exit from bankruptcy. But even before the announcement was made, Gov. Gavin Newsom declared that the plan was insufficient. He said it did too little to assure “safe, reliable and affordable power for Californians” after the series of wildfires attributed to the company’s equipment. The company’s billions of dollars in liabilities from those fires drove it to seek bankruptcy protection a year ago. The governor’s approval of its reorganization plan is essential for PG&E to take part in a $20 billion fund intended to help shield the state’s utilities from damage claims in future fires. Mr. Newsom’s objections were filed with the federal bankruptcy court hearing the case in San Francisco. The terms of the PG&E agreement with bondholders were to have been considered at a hearing on Thursday, but the judge put off the matter until next week. Until Wednesday, PG&E and its bondholders had competing plans for sorting out the company’s finances. The plan offered by the bondholders — including Elliott Management, a large hedge fund, and Pimco, the mutual-fund giant — had initially gained the support of the group representing wildfire victims in the bankruptcy. The plan would in theory have left PG&E with a stronger financial position once it emerged from bankruptcy. But it would also have almost completely wiped out the current shareholders, dominated by hedge funds. When the victims shifted their backing to PG&E’s plan, the bondholders lost much of their influence over the outcome of the bankruptcy. The agreement reached Wednesday resolves the interest payments that the bondholders will receive in the period after PG&E filed for bankruptcy protection. The two sides also agreed on the size of “make whole” payments, or the extra amounts given to bondholders when bonds are paid off before they mature. “Reaching a resolution with the bondholder group is a positive development to move forward with our plan of reorganization,” said Bill Johnson, president and chief executive of the utility’s parent company, PG&E Corporation. “This agreement helps achieve our goals of fairly compensating wildfire victims, protecting customers’ bills and emerging from Chapter 11.” Along with concerns about safety and corporate governance, Mr. Newsom objected to financial aspects of PG&E’s plan, contending that it would leave the company “with insufficient financial flexibility to make billions of dollars in critically needed safety investments.” But the bondholders’ decision to back the plan isolates Mr. Newsom, who must now decide how hard to push for his objectives. He could use provisions in a state law passed last year to deny PG&E access to the wildfire fund, a move that could cause the company’s shares to plunge, putting pressure on the hedge funds. Such an approach could also drag out the bankruptcy and delay payments to wildfire victims. In a statement, the company said it was taking the governor’s concerns seriously. “While PG&E has made substantial progress in resolving victim claims and restructuring our finances, additional changes to the plan are forthcoming. We will continue to engage with the governor’s office to address his concerns,” the company said. The bondholders played a big role in getting a larger sum for the victims. PG&E initially offered $8.4 billion but then raised the amount to $13.5 billion, the sum that the bondholders had offered to pay. Wildfire victims remain skeptical. They plan a protest in Sacramento on Friday morning in opposition to profits that shareholders could make in the bankruptcy deal and plans to fund part of the company’s damage payments with stock. “Investor groups have hijacked the bankruptcy process to ensure that they reap billions more in profits while individual fire victims receive cents on the dollar, are paid in installments, and have their recoveries funded in large part by stock in the restructured PG&E,” said Helen Sedwick, a lawyer who lost her Santa Rosa home to the 2017 wildfires. “Fire victims do not want to own any part of the company that burned their homes and killed their neighbors.” The utility’s role in the last three years of wildfires — along with the pre-emptive blackouts PG&E imposed last year when wildfire danger was at its greatest — led residents and local government officials to call for a takeover of the utility, with some proposing a government-run operation, and others seeking to create a customer-owned cooperative. Mr. Newsom said he would consider all options if PG&E failed to pay enough money to meet wildfire victims’ claims and ensure that employees’ jobs were protected. He also demanded a safety plan that would help prevent future wildfires and a strategy that continued to meet the state’s goals to transform the electric grid into a carbon-free system.

      "original_text": "Under one proposal, the Senate could convene earlier on Saturday and then hold a shorter session, allowing members to travel home or hit the campaign trail. As senators settled in for another long day of arguments from the House managers, there was already talk among lawmakers and their aides of a potentially abbreviated weekend trial schedule. Under one proposal being discussed, the Senate could convene as a court of impeachment early on Saturday, around 10 a.m. and meet for a far shorter session than usual. That would theoretically allow senators who wanted to travel home — or for Democrats running for president, to campaign in early voting states — for 36 hours before the trial resumes on Monday. The Senate’s impeachment rules normally require the trial to meet every Monday to Saturday at 1 p.m. until a verdict is reached. That late daily start time is meant to accommodate Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., who maintains a morning case schedule at the Supreme Court before presiding over the trial. But Chief Justice Roberts does not have court business on Saturdays. The decision may also depend on the president’s lawyers, who are scheduled to begin their defense against the House charges on Saturday. If they want to move the trial along as quickly as possible, they could ask for an early start on Saturday but also that the session be allowed to run into the evening. Or they could simply shorten their arguments. “I suspect we’ll start on Saturday, and then we’ll go, probably another day or two, but who knows,” Jay Sekulow, one of Mr. Trump’s lawyers said Wednesday night. “I mean we’ve got to make that determination, with our team.” Any change would require consent from both Democrats and Republicans.

      "original_text": "Democrats who once derided him now want him to testify at President Trump’s impeachment trial while some of his erstwhile Republican friends are throwing him to the curb. WASHINGTON — Not long ago, they called him “too extreme,” “aggressively and dangerously wrong” and “downright dangerous.” They called him “nutty,” “reckless” and “far outside the mainstream.” Now they would like to call him their star witness. Suddenly, John R. Bolton, the conservative war hawk and favorite villain of the left, is the toast of Senate Democrats, the last, best hope to prove their abuse-of-power case against President Trump. Democrats who once excoriated him are trumpeting his credibility as they seek his testimony in Mr. Trump’s impeachment trial. On the other side of the aisle, some of Mr. Bolton’s longtime Republican friends are just as abruptly tossing him to the curb, painting him as a disgruntled former adviser who just wants to sell books. Some of the same senators who allied with him, promoted his career, consulted with him on foreign affairs and took his political action committee money are going along as he is painted as “a tool for the radical Dems and the deep state,” as he was termed on one of the Fox News channels, part of the network where he worked for 11 years. “It’s a totally upside-down world,” said Senator Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat from Maryland who two years ago denounced Mr. Bolton’s “history of warmongering” when he was appointed Mr. Trump’s national security adviser. “But what we should all agree on is we want to get to the truth of the matter about the impeachment charges and we should accept his testimony under penalty of perjury.” There is, in fact, no agreement on that as Senate Republicans try to wrap up the trial without calling Mr. Bolton or any other witnesses in a vote likely to be held on Friday. Many Republicans argue that nothing has changed despite Mr. Bolton’s account that Mr. Trump wanted to hold up American security aid to Ukraine until it investigated his domestic political rivals — an assertion that directly contradicts the president. This is one of those moments that capture Mr. Trump’s Washington, where ideology, philosophy, party and policy mean less than where you stand on Mr. Trump — for or against him. Mr. Bolton is actually more conservative and more consistent than Mr. Trump, but since his story appears to threaten the president, he has been promptly embraced by one camp and exorcised by the other. Among those who understand what that feels like are other refugees from the Trump White House, who despite devoting what they described as endless hours trying to make his presidency a success are now branded apostates for speaking out. Among them is John F. Kelly, the former secretary of homeland security and White House chief of staff. Mr. Kelly was one of the few prominent conservatives to jump to Mr. Bolton’s defense since news of his account, included in an unpublished book submitted to the White House for review, broke in The New York Times on Sunday. “If John Bolton says that in the book, I believe John Bolton,” Mr. Kelly said during a lecture in Sarasota, Fla., according to a report in The Herald-Tribune. Mr. Kelly did not always get along with Mr. Bolton. At one point, they had a profanity-laced shouting match, after which Mr. Kelly left the White House for the rest of the day. But Mr. Kelly said Mr. Bolton “always gave the president the unvarnished truth,” adding: “John’s an honest guy. He’s a man of integrity and great character, so we’ll see what happens.” That it has come to this surprises no one who actually knows Mr. Bolton. An iconoclastic believer in a forceful approach to the world, he disdains what he views as weak-kneed conventional diplomacy, international organizations that intrude on American sovereignty and free-rider allies. When he is on someone’s side, there is no more relentless ally. When he is not, there is no more implacable foe. Loyalty to party or president takes a back seat to principle as he defines it. While President George W. Bush gave him high-ranking positions, including a recess appointment as ambassador to the United Nations, Mr. Bolton did not hold back criticizing his former boss after leaving the administration for going soft on North Korea and Iran. He wrote a bracingly candid memoir that named names and spared no one. Simply reading that would have made clear to Mr. Trump or his aides what might happen when he left this White House. And so it has. Just months after leaving Mr. Trump’s White House amid tension over policy toward Iran, North Korea, Afghanistan and Ukraine, Mr. Bolton has written “The Room Where It Happened,” to be published in March, in which he reports that the president explicitly told him that he did not want to release $391 million in aid to Ukraine until it announced investigations into his Democratic rivals, including former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. That account threw the Senate trial into temporary disarray since it undermined Mr. Trump’s defense. The president denied Mr. Bolton’s version of events, and his personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani called the former adviser a “back-stabber.” On the Fox Business channel, Lou Dobbs assailed Mr. Bolton as a tool of the president’s enemies, citing as proof the fact that he used the same literary agents as James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director fired by Mr. Trump — prompting one of the literary agents to point out that one of their other clients was Mr. Dobbs. While Mr. Bolton has left plenty of bruises over the years and he was accused of politicizing intelligence before the Iraq war, an accusation he denied, many former colleagues said he was forthcoming to a fault. “Ambassador Bolton was known for being frank and candid — in fact, some complained that his frankness and candor got in the way of a more indirect, diplomatic approach,” said Peter D. Feaver, a national security aide in Mr. Bush’s White House. “I do not recall ever hearing people complain that he made up stuff.” Democrats at this point are happy to vouch for his honesty. “I think Bolton has a lot of credibility,” Senator Thomas R. Carper of Delaware, who once called him “too extreme,” said on Fox News this week. “Not just among the Republicans but our side as well.” On the other hand, Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, said Mr. Bolton was not to be believed. “I would say that he’s a witness very interested in making a lot of money right now,” Mr. Paul said on CNN. “A month ago, he was against testifying. Now that his book is complete and available for $29.95, he’s all for testifying. So I think we need to take with a grain of salt his testimony if he comes in.” More painful for Mr. Bolton may be closer friends who have distanced themselves. Senator James M. Inhofe, Republican of Oklahoma, who called Mr. Bolton “one of my closest friends” a few weeks ago, suggested that his close friend had a grudge. “He was fired by the president,” Mr. Inhofe told reporters, although Mr. Bolton insists he resigned. “That can have an effect on a person.” Fred Fleitz, another longtime friend who served as Mr. Bolton’s chief of staff twice, most recently in the Trump White House, even wrote an op-ed article for Fox News criticizing his former boss for publishing a book about the president before the election. “Presidents have to be able to consult and confide in their national security adviser without worrying about those discussions being published,” Mr. Fleitz said in an interview on Tuesday. He added that Mr. Bolton is “a straight shooter, he’s an honest man, he’s an honorable man.” Mr. Bolton has often been misunderstood or mischaracterized. His critics call him a neoconservative, but in fact he cares little for the democracy promotion that drives actual neoconservatives. Instead, he is a hard-core “Americanist,” as he puts it, favoring tough policies up to and including the use of force to defend American interests. He supported the invasion of Iraq, he has said, not to create a Jeffersonian republic in Baghdad but to eliminate what he saw as a security threat to the United States. He has consistently advocated regime change or military action to resolve conflicts with states like Iran and North Korea and spent much of his tenure as national security adviser trying to keep Mr. Trump from entering what Mr. Bolton considered unwise agreements with enemies. He struggled over whether to testify in the impeachment hearings even as he wrote his latest book. He finally offered to appear if the Senate subpoenaed him, knowing that he would be harshly criticized if he refused to testify and his account of the Ukraine matter only became public in the book after the trial. But while colleagues said he was disturbed by the president’s actions on Ukraine — and he has openly criticized the president’s Iran and North Korea policies since leaving the White House — that does not mean that Mr. Bolton has joined the ranks of the Never Trump Republicans. Friends say he still wants a future in Republican politics, having reconstituted his political action committee shortly after leaving the White House. But they say he understands that donors would be reluctant to contribute if he was perceived as an accuser of Mr. Trump. He also remains as contemptuous of Democrats as ever and has not explicitly expressed support for impeachment or conviction. “I think the Democrats should be careful in what they wish for if they do get him as a witness,” Mr. Fleitz said. “I don’t know that he would say what they hope he would say.” PHOTO: Democrats want to call John R.

      "original_text": "Known for his prodigious memorization of the Bible, he mingled scripture with commentary on public affairs. Jack Van Impe, a televangelist who reached a wide audience interpreting current events through apocalyptic passages of the Bible and prophesying the end of the world, died on Saturday at a hospital in Royal Oak, Mich. He was 88. His death was announced by his organization, Jack Van Impe Ministries International, which did not specify a cause. He had been hospitalized after a fall this month, his longtime consultant E. Dale Berkey said. Mr. Van Impe (pronounced IMP-ee) often pronounced the imminent return of Jesus Christ and mingled discussion of Bible passages with the news of the day on his weekly television program, “Jack Van Impe Presents.” The program aired on the Trinity Broadcasting Network, through cable and satellite, for more than two decades and was said to have reached about 25,000 cities. “He was something of a pioneer televangelist, someone who was utterly confident about his esoteric interpretations of biblical prophecies,” Dr. Randall Balmer, professor of religion at Dartmouth College, said by phone. Mr. Van Impe promoted a view of the end of the world known in evangelical circles as dispensational premillennialism, which teaches that Christians will be raptured, or taken up to heaven, before a period of tribulation, a final battle called Armageddon and the return and rule of Jesus on earth. His sermons had titles like “The Coming War with Russia, According to the Bible. Where? When? Why?” (In that sermon he warned of a coming world dictator and a Russian invasion of Israel.) In his final broadcast, on Jan. 10, he discussed relations between the United States and Iran and predicted “the bloodiest war in the world,” saying it would result mostly in the deaths of “Muslim terrorists.” Robert Jeffress, the pastor of First Baptist Dallas, said in an interview that Mr. Van Impe’s premillennial view of the end times paved the way for his own ministry and that of other popular preachers like John Hagee and David Jeremiah. The evangelist Franklin Graham remembered him on Twitter as “The Walking Bible,” citing Mr. Van Impe’s extensive memorization of Bible passages. He was said to have committed about two-thirds of the Bible to memory. Jack Leo Van Impe was born on Feb. 9, 1931, in Freeport, Mich., two years after his parents, Oscar and Marie Louise (Piot) Van Impe, had immigrated to the state from Belgium during the Great Depression. His parents worked as farm laborers in sugar beet and vegetable fields after arriving in Michigan. His father later worked in a Plymouth car factory in Detroit. Jack was their only child. He had a conversion experience, becoming an evangelical Christian, when he was about 12, after his father’s similar conversion had left a strong impression on him. Jack grew up in the Detroit area and graduated from Edwin Denby High School in 1948. Three years later he received a diploma from the Detroit Bible Institute, a program that offered a Christian Worker’s Certificate, and was ordained as a minister in an independent Baptist church. A lifelong accordion player, he married Rexella Mae Shelton, a musician who also studied the Bible, in Pontiac, Mich., in 1952 after they had met at a Youth for Christ rally. Together they held crusades in cities and churches across the country and started a radio broadcast program. They started Mr. Impe’s television broadcast in 1980. The couple had no children, and his wife is his only immediate survivor. In the 1990s, Mr. Van Impe predicted that Jesus would return to earth between 2001 and 2012, according to the evangelical magazine Christianity Today. He left the Trinity Broadcasting Network in 2011, believing it had censored him after he accused the popular preachers Rick Warren and Robert H. Schuller of promoting what he called “Chrislam,” a mixture of Christian and Islam. The program was then picked up by other Christian networks. The broadcast stopped after Mr. Van Impe was hospitalized, Mr. Berkey said. The ministry said it planned to air special episodes later this year. Jack Begg contributed research.

      "original_text": "Who said a polar research base had to be ugly? Gradually, designers are rethinking how to build for the world’s harshest environment. Representatives from Brazil’s scientific community and government will head to Antarctica this month to inaugurate its new Comandante Ferraz Research Station, which replaces a facility lost to fire in 2012. The two low-slung buildings, designed by Estudio 41, a Brazilian architecture firm, house laboratories, operational support and living quarters — and could be mistaken for an art museum or a boutique hotel. “Brazil is a tropical country, so we were not used to these conditions,” said Emerson Vidigal, a principal at the firm. “These conditions” include temperatures that drop below minus 60 degrees Fahrenheit and winds that reach 100 miles per hour. Throughout the 20th century, architecture in Antarctica was a pragmatic and largely makeshift affair, focused on keeping the elements out and the occupants alive. In 1959, the Antarctic Treaty dedicated the continent to research. Since then scientists have come in growing numbers and with ever more complex needs. Construction in Antarctica, long the purview of engineers, is now attracting designer architects looking to bring aesthetics — as well as operational efficiency, durability and energy improvements — to the coldest neighborhood on Earth. “As architects, we are concerned with human comfort, so we set out to create a kind of atmosphere that would promote well-being,” Mr. Vidigal said. When British explorers built one of the first permanent structures there, in 1902, they insulated it with felt and clad it in wood. The hut was “so draughty and cold in comparison with the ship,” Ernest Shackleton, one of the crew members on that expedition, recalled, “that it was, during the first year, never used for living quarters.” As accumulating snow rendered the door impassable, the crew resorted to using a window to come and go. That sense of improvisation continued for decades. In 1956, the Royal Society founded Halley Research Station, but the facility was covered in snow by 1961 and was shut down in 1968. A replacement, Halley II, was reinforced with steel supports, but its life span was even shorter, from 1967 to 1973. Halley III lasted for 11 years, Halley IV for nine, and Halley V for nearly 15, with each rebuilding effort presenting a costly and operationally complex undertaking. When, in 2005, Halley needed rebuilding again, the British Antarctic Survey, which operates the U.K.’s Antarctic footprint, took a novel approach. Hoping to avoid yet another quick-succession project, Survey teamed up with the Royal Institute of British Architects to sponsor a design competition. The winner, Hugh Broughton Architects, designed Halley VI to last at least 20 years. In addition to being visually striking, Halley VI provides researchers with a more spacious and comfortable living and work environment. It is set on hydraulic stilts, allowing operators to lift it up out of accumulating snow drifts. And if the entire station needs to be moved — it sits on a drifting ice shelf — skis at the base of those stilts make that possible. “Before, these projects were all just about keeping the weather out,” Mr. Broughton said. “Engineers would be told, ‘This is the weather, this is the wind speed, these are the restrictions.’ But now these projects are about using architecture as a means of improving both well-being and operational efficiency.” Other countries have taken note. In 2018, Spain opened a new research station — and hired Mr. Broughton’s firm to design it. Like Halley VI, it cuts a strong figure, its modular buildings clad in bright red fiber-reinforced plastic panels. Not only do these buildings need to withstand some of the world’s most demanding conditions, but building materials need to be shipped in and assembled in the short 12-week window of summer. Most projects are built incrementally over several years. When India’s National Center for Antarctic and Ocean Research decided to build a new research station, the architecture firm it chose — bof architekten, in Germany — found a way to make construction more efficient. Rather than send shipping containers full of building materials to Antarctica and send them back empty, the architects integrated the shipping containers into the design, saving cost and time. “It’s not one of those things that you wake up say, ‘I want to build a research station in Antarctica,’ but architects provide important contributions to these projects,” said Bert Buecking, a partner at bof architeckten. For the U.S., architecture in Antarctica is a matter of some urgency. The largest American station, McMurdo, started out in 1956 as an improvised naval base, grew in an ad hoc manner over decades and needs updating. “Just to prepare for field work, scientists receive training in one building, collect field equipment in another building, pick up a snowmobile in a separate building and fuel it in another location,” said Ben Roth, the project manager of Antarctic Infrastructure Modernization for Science, or AIMS, the National Science Foundation initiative that will modernize McMurdo Station over the next decade. Mr. Roth called the existing buildings “energy hogs” — a situation that creates additional problems for scientific research at the outpost. “The more we spend to keep the buildings going, the fewer resources we have to get researchers out in the field,” said Alexandra Isern, head of Antarctic sciences at the N.S.F. In 2012, the N.S.F. hired OZ Architecture, a firm based in Denver, to develop a preliminary concept design for a new McMurdo. A separate team of architects and builders is at work developing those designs. The result will provide “creature comforts,” Mr. Roth said, including fitness centers, lounges and improved living quarters. Mr. Broughton, who is currently in Antarctica designing New Zealand’s Scott Base, noted with interest “how the approach to these projects has changed so dramatically in such a short period of time.” His peers are quick to credit him for much of that change. As Mr. Buecking put it, “when the U.K. built Halley VI, many nations realized the importance of doing something special, and not just doing something.” PHOTOS: Above, Brazil’s Comandante Ferraz Research Station, on the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, will open this month.

      "original_text": "The International Champions Cup, which brings Europe’s top clubs to North America, has been lucrative for the teams but not the organizer. Now there is a threat to end the event unless teams agree to make the competition more serious. Stephen M. Ross, the real estate developer and principal owner of the Miami Dolphins, flew to Paris this month to speak with leaders of Europe’s most powerful soccer clubs, teams that have benefited from the billionaire’s largess in bankrolling a summer tournament in the United States and beyond. For seven years Ross has plowed millions into the International Champions Cup, an annual showcase that has become very lucrative for the superstar-laden clubs that receive a coveted spot in the competition. But for Ross and RSE Ventures — the sports investment company he co-founded that controls the I.C.C. — the price of running the event has grown to more than $100 million, with no signs of a profit. Addressing management and owners from the likes of Manchester United, Juventus, Paris St.-Germain and Liverpool, Ross and RSE executives said something had to change — organizers could not keep losing money. According to multiple people familiar with the talks who requested anonymity to discuss a private meeting, the clubs were told that either the event — which teams treat as little more than a preseason tuneup — had to become more meaningful or RSE would be forced to turn off the spigot. While the I.C.C.’s games have drawn some of the biggest crowds in soccer history — 109,318 squeezed into Michigan Stadium in 2014 to watch Manchester United beat Real Madrid, 3-1 — it has failed to attract the type of investment from broadcasters and commercial partners that is necessary for a profitable future. Since the event coincides with Europe’s preseason, most clubs use it as an opportunity to build up players’ fitness and test out new, unproven talent. Top performers and big names often play limited minutes — if any — to the annoyance of fans. Ross’s group wants the teams to commit to a tournament with legitimate stakes, one with the kind of competitive tension seen in other events — something akin to taking the Champions League, Europe’s wildly popular club competition, on tour. The teams were told that, if they agreed, they could make much more money than they currently do from I.C.C. games, while Ross would finally be able to see his investment pay off. Ross’s trip included a meeting with European soccer’s governing body, UEFA. The I.C.C. organizers want to secure UEFA’s backing for any new event by having it partner with them or allow them to use its branding to give the tournament the sheen of excellence and importance they crave. Ben Sosenko, a spokesman for the tournament’s partner Relevent Sports, which is owned by RSE, declined to comment. The clubs acknowledged that the tournament needed changes, but no decisions were reached in Paris. Instead, the teams agreed to set up a joint working group with Relevent to study whether another high-profile event was desirable or feasible in global soccer’s increasingly crowded calendar. They are expected to report back in the spring. The talks came during a critical time for global soccer, as the game’s influencers are competing to shape the future of the sport and carve out their own interests. A week after the meeting in Paris, some of the same club officials traveled to Zurich for talks with Gianni Infantino, the president of FIFA. Under Infantino, FIFA has created its own international club tournament, a 24-team event to be held every four years, starting in China in 2021. The fortunes of FIFA’s new event depend on the complete buy-in of its 12 European participants, and their meeting with FIFA concluded with the clubs asking for a seat at the decision-making table and the ability to have some control over the tournament, similar to an agreement they already have with UEFA for European club tournaments. A FIFA spokesman declined to comment. Player unions may offer resistance to the I.C.C.’s plan, as they become increasingly wary of stakeholders adding to players’ workloads in pursuit of new revenue streams. Two days after the meeting in Paris, FIFPro, the main global player’s union, announced it had founded a new council that includes Vincent Kompany, the Belgian star who has spoken out about the number of games players are expected to appear in. Top leagues may also be an obstacle. They have been largely opposed to suggestions for new competitions. The Champions League itself is expected to add at least four more games starting in the 2024 season, and may even overhaul the competition entirely by implementing a so-called Swiss model. Under that proposal, all participants would play 10 games in a league format, with the top eight teams qualifying directly for the knockout stages, while the 16 teams below would compete in a playoff to join them. The idea of Champions League on tour, similar to what the I.C.C. would like to become, isn’t a new one. In fact, UEFA was considering a something along those lines when Infantino was its chief administrator, before he was elected FIFA’s president in 2016. To earn UEFA’s seal, the I.C.C. would most likely have to modify its invitation-only model, according to a person familiar with the talks. Clubs would have to be considered on merit, the person said, rather than factors like marketability and the size of their fan bases. If such an event came to fruition, it could compete with FIFA’s competition and create another front in the often bitter relationship between soccer’s two most powerful figures, Infantino and UEFA’s president, Aleksander Ceferin. The two have spent much of the last two years clashing over various issues, including FIFA’s World Cup. Most recently, tempers flared after details leaked from a meeting between Infantino and Florentino Pérez, the Real Madrid president, over Pérez’s desire to create a Super League that would unmoor the biggest teams from the domestic competitions in which they have played for decades.

      "original_text": "Two of seven crew members were rescued after the Scandies Rose, a 130-foot-long crab fishing vessel, sank on Tuesday night, the Coast Guard said. After a 20-hour search covering 1,400 square miles, the Coast Guard called off a search for five people who were missing after the fishing boat they were on sank off Alaska, officials said. The search for the missing crew members was suspended at 6:08 p.m. local time on Wednesday, “after exhausting all leads and careful consideration of survival probability,” according to a statement released early Thursday morning. “The decision to suspend an active search and rescue case is never easy, and it’s only made after careful consideration of a myriad of factors,” said Rear Adm. Matthew Bell, the 17th District Commander. “Our deepest condolences to the friends and families impacted by this tragedy.” Two crew members were rescued after the boat, a 130-foot-long crab fishing vessel called the Scandies Rose, sank near Sutwik Island around 10 p.m. on Tuesday with seven aboard, the Coast Guard said in an statement. They were rescued from a life raft by a Coast Guard helicopter, officials said. The crew members were taken to a hospital and were in stable condition, said Petty Officer Second Class Melissa McKenzie of the 17th District. Gary Cobban Jr., 61, and his son David, 30, were both aboard the boat when it sank, Deanna Cobban, the elder Mr. Cobban’s sister, said late Wednesday night. She said both of the men were among the five missing crew members. Ms. Cobban said her brother, the captain and a part owner of the Scandies Rose, was a third-generation Alaska fisherman. She described the elder Mr. Cobban as a “hard-working crab fisher” who spent all his time out on the boat. “He loved fishing,” she said. “He’s a crabber.” Mr. Cobban, who had been fishing with his son in recent years, would not have gotten on a boat if it was not safe, Ms. Cobban said. It is not clear how the boat, which was on its way to Dutch Harbor in the Aleutian Islands, sank, she said. “All we know is Gary knew he couldn’t save the boat, he put out a mayday that we’re going to have to abandon,” Ms. Cobban said. The Scandies Rose’s last known position was 170 miles southwest of Air Station Kodiak, on Kodiak Island. Coast Guard officials said at the time of the search, winds were whipping at more than than 40 miles per hour and the seas were 15 to 20 feet. The Coast Guard deployed four MH-60 Jayhawk helicopter crews, two HC-130 Hercules airplane crews and a Coast Guard Cutter Mellon that was diverted from the Bering sea.

Green Bay scored seconds into the fourth quarter to cut San Francisco’s lead to 34-13. Aaron Jones ran in the 1-yard score. Green Bay missed the 2-point conversion when receiver Davante Adams could not handle a pass from Aaron Rodgers on an out route. The Jones touchdown came after Rodgers hit tight end Jimmy Graham with a 42-yard pass, the quarterback’s longest completion of the game. The play was initially ruled a touchdown, but on review, the officials determined Graham was down before he crossed the goal line. Either way, down by three possessions, the Packers still have an uphill climb.",

      "original_text": "In 1920, Prohibition went into effect, but America partied on. As the sun rose this morning on a new year, bleary-eyed people across the United States poured out their half-drunk champagne bottles, gathered up their empty beer cans and turned to Twitter to share their resolution with the world. Dry January has begun. For those experimenting with temporary sobriety, there is pride in abstention. These droughts are self-imposed and finite — and come with social media bragging rights. But the last time we entered a decade known as the ’20s, Americans were staring down the barrel of a government-mandated dry spell, with no end in sight. For those who partook of the hard stuff, this first dry January was greeted not with determination and #goals but with denial and despair. Prohibition is most closely associated with the 1920s, but its seeds were planted a century earlier, when the national temperance movement began decrying alcohol as the root cause of societal evils including laziness, promiscuity and poverty. Eliminate the drink, they said, and Americans will be a happier, healthier and more prosperous people. The movement gained traction around the turn of the century, in large part thanks to women’s groups who saw temperance as a way to combat domestic violence. On Jan. 16, 1919 — more than a year before women could vote nationwide — the teetotalers achieved their ultimate goal: The Eighteenth Amendment, prohibiting the “manufacture, sale or transportation of intoxicating liquors” anywhere within the United States, was ratified. The country had one year to prepare. “Nobody believed it would happen,” David Wondrich, the cocktail historian, said. “Prohibition was a small-town, rural movement, and people in the cities resented it. They really thought until the very end that there was going to be a way out of it, and then, suddenly, it became clear there wasn’t.” In October 1919, over President Woodrow Wilson’s veto, Congress passed the National Prohibition Act — more commonly known as the Volstead Act, for its mustachioed champion, Representative Andrew Volstead of Minnesota — to provide for the enforcement of the Eighteenth Amendment. The law was set to take effect at 12:01 a.m. on Jan. 17, 1920. While the amendment specifically forbid purchasing or transporting alcohol, it said nothing about drinking alcohol you already had in your home. Boozehounds quickly seized upon this loophole. As businesses hustled to offload their soon-to-be illegal inventory, there was a mad dash for hooch. “Fair ladies sat in limousines behind alluring barricades of cases; business men in runabouts had cases on their knees,” The San Francisco Chronicle reported. “On every face was stamped that extraordinary and inexplicable expression of triumph mingled with apprehension which the possession of an irreplaceable treasure in a predicament of extraordinary peril is wont to imbue.” It was impossible to buy enough liquor to last a lifetime, but people tried, said Daniel Okrent, the author of “Last Call: The Rise and Fall of Prohibition.” In Hollywood, he said, “Mary Pickford’s mom bought the contents of an entire liquor store.” What businesses couldn’t sell off in bulk, they splashed out at parties, beginning with a particularly raucous New Year’s Eve and continuing right up until the last midnight, 16 days later. “Every big cafe in New York City was having a party,” Mr. Wondrich, the historian, said of the night of Jan. 16. “There were so many corks popping, it sounded like artillery fire.” Some of the restaurants even held mock funerals marking the death of alcohol. Prohibition approached like “the Fifth Horseman of the Apocalypse,” The New York Herald reported. “But, oh, how New York City’s Great Glittering Way did drink and feast before he came! And even after he had arrived and kicked the sides of his nag and made his way over the city, there was mirth enough and song enough and mockery enough to make him tremble in his dull, black boots.” Eventually the mirth ebbed, the champagne ran dry and Americans were left to stagger home into a new age. “The last day has come and gone — the inevitable hour,” The Chronicle wrote in its eulogy for booze. “At midnight all that was lawful about the spirit that cheereth and the red, red wine passed out of existence.” The New York Times took a cheekier approach with its front page headline: “John Barleycorn Died Peacefully at the Toll of 12.” The nation was officially bone dry. But unofficially, wet spots were everywhere, if you knew how to look. Bootlegging operations popped up almost immediately, leading government enforcers in a yearslong game of Whack-a-Mole. And flower shops, parking garages and basement apartments were repurposed into illicit watering holes, better known as speakeasies. Like most things, though, one’s ability to drink came down to means, according to Mr. Wondrich. If you could afford to go to fancy places, you could get the same beverages as before — only instead of 15 cents, they would now set you back a dollar. Drinking culture flourished, in spite of its being verboten. Classic cocktails like the sidecar, the bee’s knees and the French 75 all made their debut during Prohibition, Mr. Wondrich said. There were those who tried to adapt to the dry age. Many breweries found other ways to make use of their equipment: Pabst went into cheese, Yuengling and Anheuser-Busch into ice cream and Coors, in clay-rich Colorado, invested in ceramics. As for the saloons, some experimented with juices and nonalcoholic mixed drinks. There were a few successes — one boozeless cocktail created during Prohibition is known today in its spiked form as the Bloody Mary — but for the most part, the concoctions were disappointing facsimiles that “just made you sad,” Mr. Wondrich said. “Just trying to mimic spirits and classic cocktails is a recipe for failure,” explained Julia Bainbridge, the author of the forthcoming nonalcoholic cocktail recipe book, “Good Drinks.” Instead of trying to replicate the specific flavor of a negroni, you should “consider what a negroni feels like,” she added. “It’s that tension between salty and sour and sweet and bitter that pleases the human palate,” she said. “And that experience can be delivered without alcohol, with the same level of complexity, but you have to put a lot of labor into it. Basically, if you want to get something that’s not just a tiki-derivative sugar bomb, you’re going to have to cook.” Prohibition officially ended with the ratification of the Twenty-First Amendment in 1933. By then, however, the legal change was mostly a formality. “There were breweries on the West Side of Manhattan making 200,000 gallons of beer a week,” Mr. Wondrich said. “The scale of industry was so insane that the law became a joke.” Nowadays, there are bars in every big city that style themselves as Prohibition-era speakeasies, and the age’s spirit has proved enduring. “It’s that notion of doing something that’s against the law but not evil,” Mr. Okrent, the author, said. “There’s fun in defying authority.” In the past 15 years, there has also been a revival of the cocktail boom that characterized Prohibition — this time with increasingly complex and delicious options for non-drinkers, too. After all, life is too short for bad drinks. That goes whether you’re partaking of booze or abstaining from it — for a month, for life or even just for the night.

A few hours after Danny Drinkwater joined Aston Villa in the first week of January, a friend asked if he wanted to go watch his new club in action. Aston Villa was playing at Leicester City in the semifinals of the Carabao Cup, English soccer’s midweek afterthought, the night after Drinkwater’s move was confirmed. There was a space for him in an executive box at the King Power Stadium: Drinkwater could come along, pretty much incognito, and cast an eye over the Villa players who were, now, his teammates. Politely, he declined the invitation. It is not especially hard to discern why. Leicester was, of course, where Drinkwater spent the happiest, most productive years of his career: a central cog in the team that first won promotion to the Premier League in 2014 and then, as is still occasionally pointed out whenever Leicester is mentioned, won the English title two years later. It was at Leicester where Drinkwater grew into one of the most highly regarded midfielders in England. He won the Premier League. He made it to the quarterfinals of the Champions League. He played for England. He was good enough that Chelsea, the team that had succeeded Leicester as champion, paid $45 million to acquire him in 2017. A few days after that deal went through, Chelsea, in one of those quirks that soccer throws up so frequently that you wonder if the whole thing is scripted, visited Leicester. Ngolo Kanté, a player who had left Leicester for Chelsea a year earlier, was given a rousing reception by his former fans. Drinkwater, named as a substitute, a little less so. The BBC described his welcome as “mixed.” It is a fairly transparent euphemism. Perhaps that memory gave Drinkwater pause as he contemplated the idea of walking into the King Power, a few months short of three years on, to watch a game. Or, perhaps, it is something a little deeper. Perhaps he sensed that returning to Leicester, where his career topped out, would simply serve to remind him that he had fallen. Since leaving Leicester, Drinkwater has made only 14 appearances in the Premier League. A dozen of those came in his first season at Chelsea, working under Antonio Conte. The following year, Conte’s successor, Maurizio Sarri, ignored Drinkwater entirely after the Community Shield, England’s traditional — and not entirely competitive — curtain-raiser. He started this season on loan at Burnley, and — hampered by injury — he played once in the Carabao Cup and once in the Premier League. In January, frustrated by his lack of minutes, he canceled that loan and joined Villa instead. His first game was last weekend, a baptism of fire against Manchester City. Villa lost, 6-1. Drinkwater, clearly struggling to keep up, was held culpable for at least two of the goals. When he was substituted, it felt like an act of mercy. Elite sports is a brutal environment, even among those who do no more than watch it. Drinkwater’s display made him something of a figure of fun: the fact he had been exposed so surgically by Kevin De Bruyne; and the fact his last three games in the Premier League have all been defeats to Manchester City, in the shirts of three different clubs. But his story is better understood, really, as less a three-year punch line and more a cautionary tale, highlighting just how precarious a soccer career can be, the fragility of success and the damage that can be inflicted by one bad choice. In Drinkwater’s case, it all turned on leaving Leicester. Chelsea as a club wanted to sign him; Conte, it has to be said, was a little more lukewarm. When his new midfielder was presented in 2017, Conte would only say that he had “specific characteristics” that he had been looking for. When Conte left the next year, even that gossamer protection was removed. Drinkwater lost all hope under Sarri. Those who know him say his love for the game dwindled and died. He had the sense that whatever he tried would not be enough and so, after a while, he stopped trying. He felt isolated, angry, besieged. The rejoinder here, of course, is the same as it always is: money. Drinkwater went to Chelsea for more money, and he has spent much of the last two years being paid a six-figure sum every week not to do very much. Sympathy, in those circumstances, tends to be in short supply, even if the explanation for it — he had the sort of childhood that contains so little money that you understand its importance all the more — should carry some weight. But that money has not helped Drinkwater be happy. He has exhibited, in the last year or so, a self-destructive streak that has included a conviction for drunken-driving and a fight outside a Manchester nightclub that left him with damaged ankle ligaments. It is not the behavior, particularly, of a man perfectly content to pick up his paycheck and go home. Six months ago, he changed his agent, proof that he knows he has, at the very least, been poorly advised. He cannot change, now, the choices he made. But you wonder if — over the next couple of weeks of the transfer window — a few players might do well to reflect on what happened to Drinkwater — not just how far he fell, but how fast, and all because of one wrong step. Drinkwater will be 30 in March. He has lost his peak years. He is undertaking extra fitness training, and more gym sessions, to make up for the time he has lost. He is trying to rediscover, as clichéd as it sounds, his appetite for his work, his affection for the game. He knows that one choice, three years ago, has brought him here, to his last-chance saloon. End of an Era? Maybe. Probably Not. But Maybe. Barcelona, it was revealed this week, is now the richest soccer club in the world, in terms of revenue: according to the financial analysts Deloitte, it raked in $936 million last season, putting the Spanish champion ahead of Real Madrid and Manchester United for the first time. That news emerged at roughly the same time as it was becoming clear that Barcelona is most definitely not the best-run club in the world. Its dismissal of its unloved coach, Ernesto Valverde, this week proved that rather neatly. The world knew Valverde had been fired about eight hours before Barcelona confirmed it. The club owed him better. Amid all the self-immolation, one detail stood out: Lionel Messi has a clause in his contract that allows him to leave this summer. The clause, similar to one enjoyed by Xavi Hernández and Andres Iniesta previously, was included at the player’s behest, and in theory exists so Messi, 32, can assess his physical condition. In reality, it is a happiness clause: If Messi is unhappy, then he can walk. It is unlikely that he would do so, of course: he has always said his loyalty to Barcelona outstrips any contract. But it is curious to wonder not only where he would go — How many clubs can afford him? Would he want to uproot his family? What sort of offer would appeal? — but whether, perhaps, he ought to. Messi wants to win another Champions League title. That is his priority as he enters his twilight years. His presence alone means that could be with Barcelona; he can, after all, turn any game at all in his team’s favor, almost by himself. But as the chaotic firing of Valverde proves, he is not at a club with a cogent vision for its future. Might there not be some small temptation, for all his loyalty, to move somewhere he would not have to cover up everyone else’s mistakes? A Tough Sell It sounds, on the surface, like an easy task. Tottenham Hotspur needs to sign a striker to act as backup to Harry Kane: someone to relieve the burden from the club’s totem, a little, and to stand in for him when he is injured, as he is now, until April at the earliest. There are plenty of candidates: Krzysztof Piatek of A.C. Milan, a team that desperately needs to raise funds to invest elsewhere; Edinson Cavani, out in the cold at Paris St.-Germain since the arrival of Mauro Icardi; Arkadiusz Milik, never quite settled at Napoli. There are plenty of strikers good enough to be Kane’s backup. That is not the problem, though. The problem is that all of those players will know exactly how the pecking order works at Tottenham: If Kane is fit, he plays. Even if Kane is not fully fit, as the Champions League final last year proved, there is a pretty good chance that he plays. Spurs effectively have to persuade a player to come to north London with the pitch: “We want you to be our plan B.” Naturally, that limits a club’s options. Some problems in soccer can be solved by money, of course, but not all of them. If a player wants regular game time, or has international aspirations, or just plain has too much ego to accept a backup role, they will not find that prospect compelling. It is easy to say Tottenham needs to sign a supporting cast for Kane. It is much, much more difficult to find someone to take on the job. Correspondence James Armstrong has a suggestion for reviving the F.A. Cup. “The top three in the Premier League plus the F.A. Cup winner should go to the Champions League, increasing the value of the trophy,” he wrote. “Teams that are effectively out of the running in the league have a possible large payoff; the race in the Premier League becomes for the top three, not the top four, making it a little tighter.” My objection to this idea has always been that it in some way discredits the Champions League: What if a team in the top three wins the F.A. Cup, and then some no-marks get a spot in Europe’s most exclusive competition as runners-up? James has a solution: In that instance, the team that finishes fourth in the league gets the final spot. There is merit in this, but I think it is unlikely ever to come to fruition. We may have to make do with cosmetic changes — the end of replays, for example, and changing when the tournament is played — first. That’s all for this week.

      "original_text": "Under that precedent, it could in theory take only 3 Republicans to call witnesses. A premise of the escalating debate over whether the Senate should vote to call witnesses is that four Republicans would need to support that idea. Along with the 47 members of the Democratic caucus, four Republican senators would create a 51-vote majority. There’s been little discussion of it, but there’s a musty precedent from the 1868 Andrew Johnson trial whereby, in theory, it could take three Republicans. The catch is that Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. would have to support the idea, too. If only three Republicans were to vote for a motion to call witnesses, the Senate would be split 50-50. That means the motion would fail. But twice in the 1868 trial, Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase, in his role as the presiding officer, cast a tie-breaking vote on a procedural motion — which therefore passed. Some senators believed Chase lacked the power to break ties, but votes to nullify his intervention failed, creating a precedent. To be sure, both of those votes were far less momentous than a motion to call witnesses in President Trump’s trial: They involved whether the Senate should take a short break and adjourn for the day, respectively. In the 1999 impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton, Chief Justice William Rehnquist did not cast any tie-breaking votes. During debate on Tuesday on the impeachment trial rules, Republican senators blocked a bid by Democrats to leave it up to Chief Justice Roberts to decide whether evidence or testimony was relevant and should be allowed.

      "original_text": "After months of protests and an electoral defeat for pro-Beijing political parties, an official with a record of difficult assignments is on the way. BEIJING — The Chinese government abruptly replaced its top representative in Hong Kong on Saturday evening, installing a senior Communist Party official with a record of difficult assignments in inland provinces that involved working closely with the security services. The top representative, Wang Zhimin, was replaced as the head of the powerful Central Liaison Office in Hong Kong by Luo Huining, the official Xinhua news service said. The move came two months after the Chinese Communist Party’s Central Committee called for measures to “safeguard national security” in Hong Kong, although few details have been released. Mr. Wang became the first senior official to lose his job after seven months of often-violent protests in the city and a stinging rebuff to pro-Beijing political parties in local elections six weeks ago. He had devoted most of his career to Hong Kong issues and had worked closely for decades with the city’s business and political elite. But he attracted broad criticism in Hong Kong and Beijing alike for failing to anticipate the broad-based groundswell of hostility provoked by an extradition bill last spring. Mr. Wang then made no move to stop scheduled elections for neighborhood district councils in November, in the mistaken confidence that pro-Beijing candidates would maintain their longstanding dominance. Pro-democracy candidates captured 87 percent of the seats. “The massive defeat of the pro-establishment camp at the district council elections sealed his fate, but I think even before then, they had decided to remove him because he repeatedly failed to predict the mood of the city,” said Willy Lam, a specialist in Chinese factional politics at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Yet until Saturday, Beijing had at least publicly stood by Mr. Wang. When Reuters reported after the elections that he might be removed, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs office in Hong Kong dismissed the report as “false news.” Mr. Wang’s successor, Mr. Luo, has served as the top official, Communist Party secretary, in two provinces. Xi Jinping, China’s top leader, has found in him a representative whose main qualification appears to be political loyalty and experience in tough security measures, but who has little familiarity with Hong Kong. From 2003 to 2016, Mr. Luo rose through the ranks in Qinghai Province, in western China, where Beijing has pursued increasingly stringent policies toward a large Tibetan minority. Mr. Luo became governor there in 2010 and then Communist Party secretary in 2013, according to his official biography. In 2016, Mr. Xi put Mr. Luo in charge of cleaning up Shanxi Province, a northern coal-mining area plagued by corruption scandals. Mr. Luo oversaw a purge of the party’s senior ranks there, as a series of investigations documented broad misconduct. Mr. Luo is an unexpected choice to run the Central Liaison Office because of his relatively advanced age, 65, and because he has already worked as a provincial-level leader in mainland China. He was also only a month into his latest job, in China’s national legislature, suggesting that the decision to send him to Hong Kong came together fast. The Beijing leadership previously selected younger men with more expertise in the unique issues posed by Hong Kong, which has a different legal and economic system from mainland China because it was a British colony until its return in 1997 to Chinese sovereignty. Like other Chinese provincial leaders, Mr. Luo has had some dealings with Hong Kong, especially over investment and business. He held talks with his predecessor, Mr. Wang, at least once, leading a delegation from Shanxi Province to Hong Kong in late 2018. On that visit, Mr. Luo also met the city’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, to discuss investment opportunities. But he appears to have no public record of ideas for ending the unrest in Hong Kong. By contrast, Mr. Wang had spent most of his career as a Hong Kong specialist before he was named to run the office in Hong Kong in 2017. When Mr. Luo stepped down as party chief in Shanxi, in November, he said he took pride in helping to clean up the province’s “political ecology” and overhaul its economy, two tasks that Mr. Xi may also want him to take on in Hong Kong. Mr. Luo also said then that he was most grateful to have the backing of Mr. Xi and other central leaders. Mr. Wang and Mr. Luo are among the roughly 200 members of the Chinese Communist Party’s elite Central Committee, which gathers roughly once a year to discuss policy and review the performance of China’s political leadership. The extradition bill supported by Mr. Wang last spring would have allowed Hong Kong residents to be sent to the opaque and often-harsh justice system in mainland China. Mrs. Lam suspended legislative consideration of the bill in mid-June and her secretary of security, John Lee, formally withdrew it in October. There was no public indication on Saturday night of what, if any, role Mr. Wang might play in the future. Chris Buckley contributed reporting. Claire Fu contributed research.

      "original_text": "The senators pledge to do “impartial justice.” The Constitution dictates little about how the Senate must run its trial, but it does require senators sitting in judgment and the chief justice of the United States who presides to take a special oath at the outset of the proceeding. The oath that will be recited on Thursday can be traced back to 1798, when the Senate heard arguments in the impeachment of Senator Blount. Very little has changed since then, and some version of the oath was sworn at the outset of the 1868 trial of President Andrew Johnson and the 1999 trial of President Bill Clinton. The oath sworn on Thursday reads: “I solemnly swear that in all things appertaining to the trial of the impeachment of Donald John Trump, president of the United States, now pending, I will do impartial justice according to the Constitution and laws: So help me God.” When the Senate updated its impeachment rules for the television era in 1986, senators decided to incorporate a printed book where they could record their affirmation of the traditional oath, according to Daniel S. Holt, a historian in the Senate’s Historical Office.",

      "original_text": "“You called me a liar,” Bernie Sanders responded, as the candidates’ sudden clash injected new uncertainty into the Democratic presidential race. DES MOINES — The sudden clash between Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders over gender and honesty injected new uncertainty into the Democratic presidential race, after the broadcast on Wednesday evening of a recording that showed Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders trading accusations that each had called the other a “liar.” With less than three weeks before the first-in-the-nation caucuses in Iowa, the breakdown of a longstanding nonaggression pact between the two leading liberals in the race cast doubt on whether Mr. Sanders, of Vermont, or Ms. Warren, of Massachusetts, can unite the Democratic Party’s liberal wing. Polls in Iowa and New Hampshire have found all of the top candidates — Mr. Sanders, Ms. Warren, former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. — bunched up in the earliest Democratic contests, though Mr. Biden has held a steady national lead, helped to a great degree by divisions on the left. ​ ​ The rupture, which has already angered supporters of both Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders, could heighten Democratic anxieties and inject negativity into the race in Iowa, where Democrats had a history of rewarding positive behavior from presidential candidates. “I think you called me a liar on national TV,” Ms. Warren told Mr. Sanders after the presidential debate in Des Moines on Tuesday night, referring to their earlier dispute onstage over whether he told her in a private 2018 meeting that a woman could not be president. The New York Times described details of their exchange on Wednesday afternoon, and CNN broadcast an audio recording that night. According to the audio, Mr. Sanders responded, “What?” “I think you called me a liar on national TV,” she said again. “You know, let’s not do it right now,” he said. “If you want to have that discussion, we’ll have that discussion.” Ms. Warren replied, “Anytime.” “You called me a liar,” Mr. Sanders said. “You told me — all right, let’s not do it now.” Tom Steyer, the billionaire businessman, approached Mr. Sanders in the middle of the exchange. “I don’t want to get in the middle,” Mr. Steyer said. “I just want to say, ‘Hi, Bernie.’” Both the Warren and Sanders campaigns declined to comment on Wednesday. The exchange onstage between the two progressives, surrounded by onlookers but wrapped up in their intensely personal rivalry, marked their most direct confrontation in the entire 2020 election. And in some respects, it represented a kind of inevitable concession to reality: If Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders share an ideological cause, up to a point, they cannot ultimately share a presidential nomination. For Ms. Warren, taking on Mr. Sanders face-to-face risked further angering the far left, sections of which have already turned on her for the rivalry with Mr. Sanders. And while Ms. Warren was praised for addressing the subject of gender head-on during the debate, even some of her supporters acknowledge that tackling sexism so prominently could risk leaving primary voters uneasy about the implications of nominating a woman. Progressives fear the public division will benefit the moderates in the race — and, more broadly, threaten the movement they have tried to build. Leading progressive groups spent hours Wednesday trying to craft joint statements of unity while their leading political figures were in a public fight. “I am hoping that volunteers and grass-roots groups can help bridge the gap that has opened between Warren and Sanders around their 2018 conversation,” said Larry Cohen, a longtime friend and adviser to Mr. Sanders who serves as chairman of Our Revolution, the organization that spun out of the 2016 Sanders presidential campaign. “We remain focused on racial and gender justice, health care, climate crisis, good jobs, student debt and free college, the spiraling military budget and more. I don’t see a path forward on those issues in the Senate or at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee without cooperation when the time comes.” Many progressive leaders pointed to the 2004 primary as a cautionary tale, when feuding between the more liberal candidacies of Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri and former Gov. Howard Dean of Vermont helped the more moderate Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts win the Iowa caucus after a summer slump. “It’s absolutely critical that progressives focus their fire on the corporate wing of the party to not allow a repeat of the 2004 election,” said Neil Sroka, communications director for Democracy for America, a liberal group founded by Mr. Dean after his unsuccessful primary run. For Mr. Sanders, there is little upside to a drawn-out clash with Ms. Warren, particularly over matters of gender and sexism. While Mr. Sanders’s hard-core base has rallied to his side, much of the Democratic electorate still harbors feelings of resentment toward Mr. Sanders for his conduct toward Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential primaries. And in a conflict heavily focused on which candidate is telling the truth, Ms. Warren faces a real risk: Several studies have shown that voters punish women more harshly than men for real or perceived dishonesty. Depictions of female candidates as calculating or conniving are political mainstays. As long ago as 1984, opponents launched “authenticity” attacks against Geraldine Ferraro, the first woman to appear on a major party’s presidential ticket. This pattern endures regardless of who is telling the truth, these studies conclude, and regardless of either candidate’s intentions. If voters conclude that Ms. Warren is lying, it is most likely to hurt her more than it will hurt Mr. Sanders if voters conclude that he is lying. It is unclear whether either candidate may be inclined to perpetuate the feud in public. It is telling that Ms. Warren’s most pointed comment to Mr. Sanders came after the formal debate concluded, and that Mr. Sanders responded not by escalating the fight but by deferring it to another time. By the time CNN aired the footage on Wednesday night, the two candidates had not spoken about the exchange, people familiar with their whereabouts said, though they were expected to be in close contact when the Senate convenes Friday. CNN executives initially said they did not believe the exchange had been captured by the network’s microphones. The network said its journalists located a recording late on Wednesday after reviewing audio from the microphones that Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren had been wearing onstage. Over the weekend, Ms. Warren said she was “disappointed” in Mr. Sanders after Politico reported that his campaign had distributed a script to volunteers suggesting she appealed mainly to highly educated voters. On Monday, CNN reported that Mr. Sanders had told Ms. Warren in a private meeting in 2018 that he thought a woman could not win the presidency; Mr. Sanders vehemently denied it. “I thought a woman could win; he disagreed,” Ms. Warren said in a statement on Monday. On Tuesday, the issue burst forth onto the debate stage in a remarkable moment before a national audience that captured the recent friction between the two senators. “I didn’t say it,” Mr. Sanders insisted, about her characterization of his 2018 remarks. Ms. Warren disputed that, then called him her friend before pivoting to make the case that of the six candidates onstage, only the women had won all of their elections. After the debate, Mr. Steyer repeatedly insisted that he did not hear the back-and-forth between the two liberals. “I was just saying good night to the two of them,” he told reporters during a brief exchange in the debate spin room at Drake University. “I didn’t hear anything.” Reid J. Epstein and Sydney Ember reported from Des Moines, and Alexander Burns from New York. Reporting was contributed by Michael M. Grynbaum, Maggie Astor and Astead W. Herndon from New York, and Lisa Lerer from Washington. Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders did not shake hands Tuesday after a tense debate. TAMIR KALIFA FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES",

      "original_text": "The intelligence agency alerted Microsoft to a vulnerability in Windows. Typically, it would keep quiet and exploit the flaw. WASHINGTON — The National Security Agency has taken a significant step toward protecting the world’s computer systems, announcing Tuesday that it alerted Microsoft to a vulnerability in its Windows operating system rather than following the agency’s typical approach of keeping quiet and exploiting the flaw to develop cyberweapons. The warning allowed Microsoft to develop a patch for the problem and gave the government an early start on fixing the vulnerability. In years past, the National Security Agency has collected all manner of computer vulnerabilities to gain access to digital networks to gather intelligence and generate hacking tools to use against American adversaries. But that policy was heavily criticized in recent years when the agency lost control of some of those tools, which fell into the hands of cybercriminals and other malicious actors, including North Korean and Russian hackers. By taking credit for spotting a critical vulnerability and leading the call to update computer systems, the National Security Agency appeared to adopt a shift in strategy and took on an unusually public role for one of the most secretive arms of the American government. The move shows the degree to which the agency was bruised by accusations that it caused hundreds of millions of dollars in preventable damage by allowing vulnerabilities to circulate. “We wanted to take a new approach to sharing and also really work to build trust with the cybersecurity community,” Anne Neuberger, the agency’s cybersecurity director, told reporters. The vulnerability exists in Windows 10, Microsoft’s flagship operating system, as well as some versions of its server software. It allows hackers to insert malicious code into a target computer and make it appear to be from a safe and trusted source. The vulnerability could also allow hackers to decrypt secret communications. The vulnerability was serious, officials said. The National Security Agency warned government officials who oversee classified systems about the flaw and the coming Microsoft patch before discussing it publicly, Ms. Neuberger said. The agency has in the past privately shared vulnerabilities it found with Microsoft and other technology companies. During the Obama administration, officials said, they shared about 90 percent of the flaws they discovered. But the agency never allowed those firms to publicly identify the agency as the source of those discoveries, Ms. Neuberger said. The agency wanted the public acknowledgment of its role in finding the new defect to demonstrate the importance of patching the flaw, she said. “Ensuring vulnerabilities can be mitigated is an absolute priority,” Ms. Neuberger said. The National Security Agency’s action suggests the vulnerability for American government systems likely outweighed its usefulness as a tool for the agency to gather intelligence. Experts and technology companies praised the agency. But some noted that even as one arm of the government was moving to protect the public’s ability to encrypt its communications, another was taking the opposite tack. A day earlier, the Justice Department called on Apple to break the encryption on its phones, and it has pushed for so-called back doors on Facebook’s encrypted message services. The Washington Post earlier reported on the agency’s warning to Microsoft, which released a patch for the vulnerability on Tuesday. Customers who automatically update their operating systems or applied Tuesday’s patch “are already protected,” said Jeff Jones, a senior director at Microsoft. Microsoft said no evidence had emerged that malicious actors had exploited the vulnerability and said its security software could detect malware trying to do so. The National Security Agency’s decision to reveal the flaw to Microsoft — and then to publicly announce its move — is in sharp contrast to how it handled another flaw that it discovered but told Microsoft about too late to prevent global damage. In early 2017, agency officials told Microsoft’s president, Brad Smith, that it had found a flaw in its operating systems but lost it to a group called the Shadow Brokers, which somehow obtained hacking tools that the United States had used to spy on other countries. The agency had known about the flaw for some time but held on to it, believing that one day it might be useful for surveillance or the development of a cyberweapon. But when the agency’s arsenal of flaws leaked out — presumably through insiders, though the National Security Agency has never said — among it was code nicknamed “Eternal Blue.” While Microsoft had raced to get people to patch the erroneous code, many systems remained unprotected. Soon North Korean hackers used the code to develop “WannaCry,” software that crippled the British health care system, which used an outdated version of Microsoft Windows. And Russian hackers used it in the NotPetya attacks, among the most damaging cyberattacks in history, costing hundreds of million of dollars to companies including FedEx and Maersk, the shipping giant. The agency dismissed the idea that it was responsible for the malicious use of the code — arguing that the responsibility lay with North Korea and Russia, which mounted the attacks. But privately, many agency officials acknowledged that the tendency to hoard such flaws in hopes of developing weapons had come at a huge price and that the United States bore some responsibility for the damage caused by Eternal Blue and other tools. Some experts believe Eternal Blue is continuing to cause problems, allowing hackers to disrupt computer systems. The White House often decides whether to hold on to a flaw for future use or reveal it to the manufacturer. Obama administration officials set up a system to make the decision. Trump administration officials say a similar process still exists, but they have stopped publishing information about the percentage of vulnerabilities they make public. The National Security Council reviewed the latest decision to share information about the new flaw with Microsoft, Ms. Neuberger said. The vulnerability involves Windows’ digital signature system, according to one of the people familiar with the issue. Microsoft, and other companies, use digital signatures to identify software and updates as authentic. The vulnerability unearthed by the National Security Agency could potentially allow a hacker to add a fake signature that could allow malware to be inserted onto a vulnerable computer. Because the vulnerability was not yet public, no known malware has taken advantage of it. Criminal hackers or nation states typically take weeks to exploit a new vulnerability, so businesses, governments and individuals may have a little time to install the security patch developed by Microsoft. Experts urged them to move quickly nonetheless. It was not clear how much of a strategic shift the agency’s announcement amounted to. The agency presumably is still hunting for vulnerabilities and flaws that could allow them to infiltrate Iranian computer systems, as well as those used by Russia, China and other adversarial countries. But if the agency continues to follow the example set Tuesday, future vulnerabilities that affect not just one critical computer system but instead millions of users or more across the world, its experts could help fix the problem rather than exploit it.

      "original_text": "Kimberly Gardner, the top prosecutor in St. Louis, who is under investigation herself, is accusing city officials of a “racially motivated conspiracy” to stop her from doing her job. A battle between St. Louis’s first African-American top prosecutor and the city’s largely white legal establishment escalated this week, with the prosecutor suing her opponents under a little-used federal law passed in the wake of the Civil War to stem violence by the Ku Klux Klan. Kimberly Gardner, the St. Louis circuit attorney, accused city officials, the local police union and a special prosecutor of a “racially motivated conspiracy to deny the civil rights of racial minorities” by interfering with her efforts to to crack down on police misconduct and to institute changes in the city’s criminal justice system. The targets of her suit, filed on Monday in Federal District Court in St. Louis, sharply denied the accusations, with the police union calling the legal action “frivolous, desperate and pathetic” and characterizing the decision to file it as “the last act of a desperate woman” who is herself under investigation by the special prosecutor. The tension between Ms. Gardner and other officials in St. Louis is one of many flashpoints around the country between the traditional law enforcement establishment and a new wave of prosecutors who were elected after promising to rein in police misconduct, send fewer nonviolent offenders to prison and repair relationships with minority communities. On Tuesday, several other district attorneys from across the country, all of them African-American women, traveled to St. Louis to support Ms. Gardner at a rally with civil rights activists, saying she had been the target of a “fundamentally racist” system that has also thwarted some of their efforts. “The keepers of the status quo that brought us mass incarceration, the over-criminalization of poor black and brown people, tough sentences, no redemption and no second chances won’t give up their power quietly,” said Marilyn Mosby, the chief prosecutor of Baltimore, who was joined by Aramis Ayala of Orlando and several others. With her lawsuit, Ms. Gardner is in effect asking for a federal judge to step inside the workings of the city and the local court system to stop her civil rights from being violated under the Constitution and an 1871 law commonly called the Ku Klux Klan Act, which criminalized efforts to re-enslave African-Americans. More recently, the law has been wielded in a lawsuit against the promoters of the 2017 white power rally in Charlottesville, Va., accusing them of a conspiracy to commit violence against a racial minority. It was also invoked during the civil rights era to try to stop Southern sheriffs from blocking African-Americans from voting, said Peter Joy, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis. But proving that the law applies in Ms. Gardner’s situation would require a significant amount of evidence, he said. “It’s a pretty high bar to clear.” Ms. Gardner has been at war with much of the St. Louis police force and the local legal establishment since she was elected in 2016, two years after nearby Ferguson, Mo., erupted in protest over a killing by a police officer. The St. Louis police force is mistrusted by many in the African-American community, which makes up half the city’s population. She took several steps to make the Police Department more accountable, including creating a list of more than 50 officers who could not bring cases for prosecution to her office because of concerns over their credibility. She also indicted the state’s governor at the time, Eric Greitens, who had been a rising star in national Republican politics. The business manager of the local police union, Jeff Roorda, has called for Ms. Gardner’s indictment, and he recently went on a radio show to suggest that she be removed from office “by force or by choice.” A special prosecutor, Jerry Carmody, began investigating Ms. Gardner in 2018 after Mr. Greitens’s lawyers accused her of allowing the perjury of a former F.B.I. agent whom she hired to investigate the governor. Ms. Gardner has said that she did nothing wrong, and that she corrected the former agent’s errors as soon as she learned about them. She later dismissed the case against Mr. Greitens. In an interview, Ms. Gardner said the lawsuit was about making sure she was allowed to implement the platform she was elected on. “We’re not going to let fear and injustice stop the reforms that are needed,” she said. “This is also about the continuing attacks on progressive prosecutors, not just in St. Louis, but around this country.” Mr. Carmody has said that his investigation of Ms. Gardner is continuing, which she has described as a way to limit her effectiveness by keeping a cloud of uncertainty over her future. As evidence of a conspiracy against her, Ms. Gardner’s lawsuit notes that one of Mr. Greitens’s chief defense lawyers is a longtime friend of Mr. Carmody, creating what she called a conflict of interest that made Mr. Carmody an improper choice to investigate a complaint filed by the governor’s legal team. He was appointed by a state judge at the request of the city’s police force after the complaint was filed. Mr. Carmody did not return a call seeking comment on the lawsuit. Jacob Long, a spokesman for the St. Louis mayor’s office, said: “The city of St. Louis vehemently denies what it considers to be meritless allegations levied against it by Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner. The city fully expects to be vindicated.” PHOTO: Kimberly Gardner, the state circuit attorney for St. Louis, is the first African-American to hold that position in her city’s history.

      "original_text": "Muhammad Haryz Nadzim became the youngest current Mensa member after scoring 142 on an I.Q. test. Above 145 is considered “genius or near genius.” LONDON — He reads fluently (while wearing a Gruffalo costume), he does math with ease and he can explain scientific concepts such as how rain forms. He is also 3 years old. The toddler, Muhammad Haryz Nadzim, was invited last week to join Mensa, a British society whose membership rules require an I.Q. in the top 2 percent of the population. Haryz, as his family calls him, received an invitation to the society after meeting with a consultant psychologist who assigned him a score of 142 using the Stanford-Binet intelligence test. Scoring above 145 is considered “genius or near genius,” according to the test’s website. The 3-year-old is now Mensa’s youngest current member, the society said in an email on Wednesday. The youngest-ever member was age 2 years 4 months at the time of joining. Haryz’s mother, Nur Anira Asyikin, said on Instagram, “My mini brainbox just got invited at his little age to be part of Mensa,” and congratulated her “very very clever” son. Mensa was formed in Oxford, England, in 1946 by Roland Berrill, an Australian lawyer, and Lance Ware, a scientist and lawyer. It has more than 110,000 members across the world. Meeting the membership criteria usually means taking an I.Q. test supervised by the society. For children under age 10 and a half, Mensa says on its website, an assessment by an educational psychologist must be made. That report is then submitted as evidence to support membership, as happened in the case of Haryz. Ms. Asyikin could not be reached for comment on Wednesday, but she said in a CNN report that her son was “very much your typical 3-year-old,” adding that he particularly enjoyed playing with modeling clay and toy bricks. Ms. Asyikin is an engineer and the family lives in Durham, in northeastern England, according to CNN. An Instagram page dedicated to Haryz’s exploits includes a video of the youngster reading books, including “The Gruffalo,” by Julia Donaldson, singing nursery rhymes, and — just before his second birthday — recounting the story of the Gingerbread Man. In a video posted on his Instagram profile on Tuesday, Haryz does simple mathematics: “Two plus six equals eight,” he tells the camera, drawing numbers and symbols in the air. Ann Clarkson, a Mensa spokeswoman, said in an email on Wednesday that a high I.Q. was “like a toolbox — it gives children the equipment to learn, but they still have to put in the effort and practice to become expert at something.” Though all children are unique, she said, what makes Haryz different is “his ability to learn very quickly and process information fast.” Child prodigies have long caused admiration and interest. Alma Deutscher, from Austria, was composing piano melodies at age 4 and played Carnegie Hall in New York in December at age 14. In Belgium, Laurent Simons, a 9-year-old, was on course last year to become one of the youngest people in the world to graduate from a university. But the pressure that comes with such gifts can take a toll in the long term. Saul Chandler, a former violin prodigy who played Carnegie Hall twice before age 13 and suffered a nervous breakdown by 16, told The New York Times in 2018, then age 70, that if he could forget music, he would. “They turned me into a trained monkey,” he said, adding that he would not want to be remembered for his childhood achievements. “Because I ended up doing a lot of other great things in my life, too.” Despite her obvious delight in Haryz’s talents, Ms. Asyikin hinted at the pressures in an Instagram post. Whatever her son went on to achieve, she wrote, “we will always be proud of you.”",

      "original_text": "Brandon M. Magnan claimed to be part of security for the president’s helicopter and was able to get through two checkpoints at Palm Beach International Airport, the authorities said. A former United States Marine posed as a security team member for Marine One, the helicopter that transports President Trump, and breached two checkpoints last week at Palm Beach International Airport, the authorities said. The former Marine, Brandon M. Magnan, 37, of Naples, Fla., was charged on Jan. 6 with false personation of officer or employee of the United States, according to a criminal complaint by the United States Secret Service. It wasn’t clear why Mr. Magnan was trying to get near the helicopter. Marine One, which is piloted and protected by the Marine Corps unit known as HMX-1, is used to transport the president for shorter trips, the Secret Service said. Mr. Trump was spending his winter vacation in Palm Beach, Fla., at his private Mar-a-Lago resort at the time of the episode with Mr. Magnan. On Jan. 5, a protective zone was established around Atlantic Aviation, which provides hangar space, jet fuel sales and flight support services, as Mr. Trump was preparing to leave West Palm Beach for Washington, the authorities said. Mr. Magnan was driving a Honda Pilot with an unidentified male passenger at about 3 p.m. when they approached a security checkpoint. Mr. Magnan identified himself as a member of HMX-1 and presented a credential that indicated he was a law enforcement officer with the United States Marine Corps, according to the complaint. Investigators said the credential bore the seals of the Marines and the Marine Corps Executive Flight Detachment. Mr. Magnan was permitted through the checkpoint. He presented the same credential at a second checkpoint, where he was allowed to proceed, the complaint said. But a sheriff’s deputy there noticed that Mr. Magnan was not wearing a Marine Corps uniform, which is standard during presidential travel, the complaint said. The deputy contacted members of the security detail, who identified the credential as fake. When confronted, Mr. Magnan told law enforcement officers that he was a retired member of HMX-1, the complaint said. The Secret Service found that Mr. Magnan had served with the Marines until he was dishonorably discharged about 10 years ago after being convicted at a court-martial for “serious offenses.” Mr. Magnan is listed in the Florida Department of Law Enforcement Sex Offender registry for convictions in 2010 in military court related to abusive sexual conduct and sodomy. In one case, a lance corporal testified that he fell asleep in a hotel room with Mr. Magnan after the Marine Corps ball and awoke to find Mr. Magnan’s hand in his pants and over his boxer shorts, according to military court records. Mr. Magnan was released on a $100,000 bond, according to court records. Neither Mr. Magnan nor his lawyer, Peter Vincent Birch, could be reached on Saturday. If convicted, Mr. Magnan faces a maximum of three years in prison, a fine of $250,000 and a year of supervised release. He has a court hearing scheduled for Jan. 27. It was not clear who the unidentified man traveling with Mr. Magnan was or whether he was arrested. It was also unclear how close Mr. Magnan got to Marine One or how many more security checkpoints he faced. The episode is the latest security breach related to Mr. Trump and his visits to Mar-a-Lago. Last month, a Chinese national trespassed at the private club and was arrested when she refused to leave. In March 2019, a Chinese woman was arrested after gaining entry at the club while carrying four cellphones and other electronic equipment. Michael Levenson contributed reporting.

      "original_text": "The country is venting frustration with Prime Minister Scott Morrison over what many view as a nonchalant response to the disastrous blazes and his unwavering dismissal of climate change. HASTINGS, Australia — The posters have popped up on streets around Australia, showing the prime minister looking very tropical: floral wreath on his head, ocean-blue shirt open at the collar. “MISSING,” they blared. “Your country is on fire.” The immediate reference was clear. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has been widely castigated for taking a vacation to Hawaii last month, and trying to keep it quiet, while Australia was in the early clutches of one of its most devastating fire seasons ever. But the message went well beyond one island getaway. Angry and frightened, Australians have been venting their frustration with Mr. Morrison over what they see as his nonchalant and ineffectual response to the disastrous blazes and his unwavering dismissal of the force that has made them so intense: climate change. With thousands fleeing eastern towns this weekend as fires swept from the hills to the coast, the inescapable realities of a warming world were colliding with the calculated politics of inaction. Mr. Morrison has minimized the connection between climate change and Australia’s extreme environmental conditions, even as the country just completed its hottest and driest year on record. He has derided calls to end coal mining as “reckless,” prioritizing economic interests and loyalty to a powerful lobby. He has opposed taxing heat-trapping emissions or taking other significant steps to reduce them, although a majority of Australians say the government should take stronger action. And he has signaled no change in his policies even as 24 people have died, hundreds of homes have been destroyed, and more than 12 million acres have burned, an area larger than Denmark. On Sunday, weather conditions eased a bit, with light rain in some areas, but blazes were still burning in Victoria and New South Wales, and some towns were being evacuated. “The thing that strikes everyone about the present situation is the federal government’s disengagement and lethargy, to put it politely,” said Bill Hare, director of Climate Analytics, a policy institute. “People are just bewildered,” he added. As the fire conditions worsened over the weekend, Mr. Morrison defended his government’s response and announced a military mobilization — one that he quickly promoted in a video on social media, drawing widespread criticism. He also denied that his government had played down the links between global warming and changes in Australia’s weather patterns. “The government has always made this connection, and that has never been in dispute,” he said. The prime minister said he was undeterred by the anger directed at him. “There has been a lot of blame being thrown around,” he said. “Blame: It doesn’t help anybody at this time, and over-analysis of these things is not a productive exercise.” Mr. Morrison’s attempt at damage control came as Australians have been voicing a growing sense since November, when the fires arrived early and with far more force than usual, that the government is no longer protecting them in the way it once did. For much of the time since, the prime minister said that it was not the time to talk about climate change, and that those who did were merely trying to score political points. But each surge of the flames into crowded suburbs and coastal getaways has presented a fresh test of Mr. Morrison’s defense of the status quo. He has sought to tamp down outrage mostly with photo opportunities and a populist appeal that echoes President Trump. Mr. Morrison has portrayed those who support greater climate action as effete snobs trying to impose their ways on an unwilling quiet majority. The prime minister published a New Year’s message in newspapers across Australia that pushed back against international pressure for the country to do more. “Australians have never been fussed about trying to impress people overseas or respond to what others tell us we should think or what we should do,” Mr. Morrison said. “We have always made our own decisions in Australia.” Critics suggest that his antipathy toward action on climate change has contributed to what they consider a hands-off response to the fires, treating them as a tragedy rather than a turning point. For months, Mr. Morrison rebuffed calls for a more forceful intervention by the federal government — like a broad military deployment or the largely symbolic declaration of a national emergency — by noting that firefighting had long been the responsibility of individual states. He changed course on Saturday, announcing a call-up of military reservists and new aircraft resources. The prime minister also initially resisted pressure to compensate the thousands of volunteer firefighters who are performing the overwhelming bulk of the work to protect communities. He later relented, approving payments for each of up to about $4,200, or 6,000 Australian dollars. The decision came a week after he cut his Hawaii trip short and returned to Australia following the deaths of two volunteer firefighters. Mr. Morrison, who began his professional life in tourism, has been mocked online with the hashtag #scottyfrommarketing. On New Year’s Day, as fire victims surveyed the destruction from the wildfires under orange skies, photos emerged of Mr. Morrison hosting the Australian cricket team in Sydney. “It reminds me of the George W. Bush moment after Hurricane Katrina in 2005,” said Daniel Flitton of the Lowy Institute, a nonpartisan policy center in Australia. “He seemed to be out of touch, and misread the depths of public concern. That became a lodestone he had to carry for the rest of his term in office.” More recently, Mr. Morrison has tried to defend Australia’s environmental policies, portraying his government as taking firm action. He said repeatedly in a news conference on Thursday — his first since before Christmas — that the government was on course to “meet and beat” its emission reduction targets. Climate scientists say those targets were low to begin with. And Australia’s emissions have been rising, while the leadership continues to fight for the right to emit even more. During United Nations climate talks in Madrid late last year, Australia came under heavy criticism for proposing to carry over credits from the two-decade-old Kyoto Protocol to help it meet its targets under the landmark Paris accord. “We are laggards,” said Joseph Camilleri, an emeritus professor of politics at La Trobe University in Melbourne, where he specializes in existential threats, including climate change. “What the Australian fires do best is show us that climate change is now with us here and truly,” he added, “and everyone, including Australia, needs to do an awful lot more than we are doing.” Australia’s conservative leaders often point out that the country accounts for only a tiny percentage of the world’s heat-trapping emissions. But some experts called the Madrid maneuver a potentially pernicious example from a country that continues to extract and export huge amounts of coal that ends up being burned in power plants around the world. “The government claims it has reduced emissions,” Mr. Hare said. “What they’re using are essentially accounting tricks to justify or explain their reasoning.” In his news conference on Thursday, Mr. Morrison framed the government’s climate policy in a way he often has before, as something he will not let get in the way of continued prosperity. He also asked Australians to trust the government and to be patient. To many, that appeal did not match the gravity of the fear and anxiety coursing through the country. Jim McLennan, an adjunct professor specializing in bush-fire preparedness at La Trobe University, said that many of the regions affected this season had no recent history of severe bush fires, making it difficult for communities to prepare. Australians are also emotionally unready, he added, for the extreme future that most likely awaits them. Some scientists say people may have to throng to cities to escape the threat of bush fires. “I can’t think of a time,” he said, “where we have had so many serious fires occurring in so many different parts of the country at roughly the same time. It is a kind of new world.” Mr. Morrison may be able to weather the political storms. The next election is two years away, and he is fresh off a surprise electoral victory in which he was buoyed by support in Queensland, a coal-mining center. But across the country’s heavily populated eastern coast, the public’s patience is nearly exhausted and turning rapidly to fury. Hours after the news conference on Thursday, Mr. Morrison visited a fire-ravaged community, Cobargo, to see the damage and pledge support to residents. They heckled him out of town. “You left the country to burn,” one person yelled before the prime minister walked away and set off in his car. In Mallacoota, another devastated community in southeastern Australia where hundreds of people were evacuated by naval ship to the town of Hastings, Michael Harkin, a vacationer from Sydney, said his experience during the fires had intensified his anger toward the government over its inaction on climate change. The Morrison government, he said, was exhibiting “incompetent governance avoiding the inevitable.” “They’re not keeping us safe at all,” he added. Livia Albeck-Ripka reported from Hastings, Jamie Tarabay from Hong Kong and Isabella Kwai from Sydney, Australia. Damien Cave contributed reporting from Miami.

      "original_text": "TOKSOOK BAY, Alaska — The 2020 census officially began on Tuesday in Toksook Bay, an Alaskan village on the edge of the frozen Bering Sea where census takers hoped to show they can overcome language barriers, isolation and government distrust to develop an accurate tally for minority groups who have long suffered from undercounts. Visitors traveling to the village of about 650 must fly 500 miles from Anchorage, and then scoot into town on the back of a snow machine or four-wheeled A.T.V. — the same ones that deliver the mail to a post office the size of a small backyard shed. On Tuesday, a small advance team spent much of the day anxiously waiting to see whether a planeload of senior Census Bureau officials, flying in for a ceremonial early start of the once-a-decade national tally, would make it through the thick winter fog. “Counting those who are in hard-to-reach villages has been a challenge for the Census Bureau every decade since 1870,” said Steven Dillingham, the bureau’s director, ahead of his trip to Toksook Bay. “Here in Alaska, we have these very special challenges. The geography is so vast.” The census, scheduled to get underway in most of the country in mid-March, provides a vital foundation of data used to determine everything from congressional representation to federal spending on education, health care and food assistance. This year, there are renewed calls for special attention to minority neighborhoods and Indigenous communities like Toksook Bay. In many such places, traditional methods have historically failed to count some people who may be invisible as a result of the federal government’s inability to overcome geography, language barriers or the reluctance of some residents to interact with government representatives. The Census Bureau estimated that Native Americans and Alaska Natives living on reservations were undercounted by about 4.9 percent during the 2010 census, more than twice the rate of the next closest population group. Many advocates fear that a now-abandoned Trump administration effort to ask about citizenship status may have already set the stage for a depressed count among immigrant groups. The census hopes to avoid an undercount by using partners who can help lay the groundwork in minority communities, hiring people with knowledge of local neighborhoods to do the actual count and producing videos in 59 languages that explain how to fill out census forms. A new advertising campaign targeting minority groups is intended to convey that the process is easy, important and confidential. Donna Bach, hired last year as a “partnership specialist” to help pave the way for the count in Alaska, said she had already spent months giving presentations to tribal leaders and meeting with local officials to explain why the census matters. Money derived from census data totals about $3.2 billion in Alaska, funding health programs, local clinics and education programs like Head Start. Census-derived funding also goes toward improvements to roads and runways, critical to remote Alaska Native villages like Toksook Bay, where people rely on airplanes that deliver mail, medicine and the food to stock store shelves. “We tell everyone there are 3.2 billion reasons why the census matters,” Ms. Bach said. Census representatives are beginning their sweep through rural Alaska during the frigid weeks of winter because frozen ground allows easier access to some villages, and residents are more likely to be home before the spring thaw draws them to their fishing grounds. In Toksook Bay, where small houses painted in vibrant colors of green, orange, red and blue rise from the ice and snow during the long Alaskan winter, almost everyone is Alaska Native. They subsist on the local wildlife: fish, the occasional moose and seal. Garlands of dried herring tied up with braided grass hang outside the doors of many homes. As in most other Alaska Native villages, there are no paved streets and no addresses. People from the outside — the term Alaskans use for the Lower 48 states — do not often visit, and most residents grow up speaking their native Yup’ik language, Yugtun, before learning English. Not everybody has internet access, mirroring trends among Native communities around the country. Despite concerns about reaching Indigenous communities, the Census Bureau, working with a tight budget, has pressed ahead with a plan to prioritize an internet-based head count; much of the country will get an invitation to fill out information online, and those who do not respond will be contacted in other ways. The online option offers a cheaper solution at a time when some states, including Alaska, are ramping up their own spending to make sure their residents participate. Census Bureau officials said they would not rely on an internet count in remote Alaskan villages such as Toksook Bay. After spending hours waiting in Bethel for the fog to clear, Mr. Dillingham and other Census Bureau officials arrived in Toksook Bay to begin the count on Tuesday afternoon. Mr. Dillingham’s first stop was at the home of the village’s oldest resident, Lizzie Chimiugak, to count her as the first census participant. Mr. Dillingham then went to the school gym, where high school students were dressed in red, white and blue handmade shirts known as kuspuks and hand-beaded headdresses — nasqerrun — topped with wolf and beaver fur. “We’re trying to count everyone, and here we are in remote Alaska,” Mr. Dillingham said, out of breath as he ran down the hall toward the gym. After a brief visit, and with snow starting to fall, the census crew rushed off to avoid being trapped again by the weather. Other census workers will be continuing the count in coming days. In Alaska and elsewhere, the bureau has been slow to hire the partnership specialists who are supposed to be key liaisons to build support in local communities before counting begins. There are added worries that people hired to do the counting may not be prepared for a job involving travel by bush planes, A.T.V.s and even dog sleds, along with lodging in schools or in the homes of local residents who may be wary of outsiders from the government. As census leaders prepared to begin the count in recent weeks, they readied an advertising campaign to reach Native residents living in remote villages of Alaska to help begin building trust. But the effort stumbled almost immediately. An advocate for Alaska Natives said that when she finally heard a planned radio spot in November, she immediately raised concerns, among them that some names of Alaskan groups had been mispronounced. “I was shocked,” said Nicole Borromeo, the general counsel for the Alaska Federation of Natives. The census has scrambled over the past several days to prepare a new ad, but Ms. Borromeo said the production quality was not on par with other census advertising campaigns. The delay in bringing partnership specialists on board has been an issue around the country. The Government Accountability Office found that the Census Bureau missed its hiring targets last year and warned that it could have a negative impact in hard-to-count areas. In Alaska, Ms. Borromeo said the census had hired one and was in the process of bringing in two others. She said the bureau should have had 12 partnership specialists in place in Alaska a year ago to begin laying the groundwork for the count. “Better late than never,” she said. Noting the estimated 4.9 percent undercount in the 2010 census, James Tucker, a Las Vegas attorney and vice chair on the National Advisory Committee to the Census Bureau, said the rate was likely much higher. “We received feedback from many communities that the census numbers from 2010 were much lower than the number of people living in those communities,” he said. “The challenge is estimating the number of people who were missed.” Kevin Allis, the chief executive of the National Congress of American Indians, said local communities have had to fund their own efforts to build grass-roots engagement in preparation for the count. “We’re filling in the gaps here because if we don’t do it, then our folks don’t get counted,” Mr. Allis said. In Toksook Bay, Robert Pitka, the local tribal administrator, said he had talked about the census at public meetings, at evening practices for the community dance group and during a tribal membership meeting this month. He has relayed his message to tribal administrators in neighboring communities: Tununak, seven miles to the north, and Nightmute, about 14 miles to the east. “This is to benefit for the next 10 years for our children, our grandchildren’s future,” he said.

      "original_text": "South Dakota has four dead presidents carved in stone on Mount Rushmore. But good luck getting real, live presidential hopefuls to come visit. LE MARS, Iowa — As the longtime owner of Archie’s Waeside steakhouse, Bob Rand has a story about almost everybody who wanted to be, or was, president in the past few election cycles. Once, during the 2016 presidential race, Ben Carson and his campaign team showed up unannounced, and hungry. President George W. Bush’s security detail shut down the highway so he could arrive safely in town. Bob Dole came to the restaurant during his bid for the presidency, walked into the cooler and cut his own steak from a side of beef. “It was the damnedest thing I ever saw in my whole life,” said Mr. Rand, reminiscing in the wood-paneled dining room, as waitresses pushed metal carts loaded with plates of New York strip and homemade hash browns to diners in booths. Forty miles away, across the snowy terrain of bent cornstalks and grain silos, steak was also on the menu. Members of the local V.F.W. club were shooting pool at Whimp’s Place, as diners sat before plates of tenderloin. The owner, Dan Radigan, could remember just one politician who pushed through the restaurant’s door. “I think Senator Thune was here once,” he said. The key difference between the two steakhouses: geography. Whimp’s is in South Dakota, where the Republican senator John Thune is from, and Mr. Rand’s steakhouse is in Iowa, the center of the political universe during this time of the presidential election cycle with its caucuses set to take place Feb. 3. A robust lineup of presidential wannabes has swung by practically every steakhouse, cafe, bowling alley, brew pub and American Legion post in Iowa, from Wapello to Webster City, in past months. Across the state line, and across the nation, the question rings out each election cycle: Why does Iowa, a state of barely more than three million people, get all the attention? Since 1972, Iowa has held its nominating contests first, a result of a national Democratic Party decision to spread out the schedule among states. Because Iowa’s process is so complicated, it had to start early. Candidates dutifully show up. But that doesn’t mean they like it. Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren recently complained about Iowa’s prominence in picking a candidate, and Julián Castro, before he dropped out of the race, said Iowa was “not reflective of the United States” and “not reflective of the Democratic Party.” Elections, by their nature, highlight how much a person’s ZIP code can determine how decisive his or her vote will be. The early states and the swing states are lavished with attention. Others states are largely ignored. That is particularly poignant in South Dakota, where the primary takes place in June. Far from the Iowa border in South Dakota communities like Rapid City, brushes with the presidency generally are limited to the bronze sculptures of 43 presidents scattered about town or the carvings of former presidents on the side of nearby Mount Rushmore. But on the state line, politically active citizens blanch when caucuses are days away and attention, for once, is focused on the middle of the country — but not their slice of the middle of the country. “There’s this flyover mentality that we’re not important. We’re ignored as a people and a voice, and Iowa’s got this outsized attention,” said Susan Almjeld, a music teacher who was sipping Old-Fashioneds with her husband, Paul, on a recent evening at Whimp’s. Burbank, where the Almjelds live, is close enough to the Iowa border to be part of its media market. Residents are inundated with ads for candidates on their televisions and radios. Ms. Almjeld works at a school in Iowa, and, from time to time, has considered driving to see candidates in person. But a touch of bitterness sets in. “Sometimes I think, oh my God, they’re only a half-mile away,” she said, “but then again I’m comfortable on my couch, and I’m not part of the caucuses anyway.” Other South Dakotans make the trek. Michelle Randall of Sioux Falls, S.D., has traveled to Iowa to snap a photo with almost every major presidential candidate this election cycle, in case they never make it to her home state. “By the time the primary comes to us the race is practically decided,” she said. “They say we’re the forgotten ones, and we kind of are.” Ms. Randall has been in Elizabeth Warren’s selfie line and saw John Delaney in a crowd of 22 people at Old 60 Steaks & Chops in Sheldon, Iowa. She was determined enough that she managed to snap a photo with Bill de Blasio during the New York mayor’s long-shot campaign. “I drove in a snowstorm to see him in Sioux City,” she said. “It was right after he declared. That was in a bar. I was literally standing there having a beer with Bill de Blasio. He was very politician-y, all Mr. Common Man and everything. Didn’t have a whole lot to say, just a little small talk. It was almost a little uncomfortable.” Ms. Randall has set rules for her quest: She won’t drive more than two hours, except to see her favorite candidate, Pete Buttigieg, whom she has traveled to see several times and even knocked on doors in Iowa to rally support for him. At a recent town hall event in Orange City, Iowa, Ms. Randall heard Mr. Buttigieg tell the crowd of about 150, “You will be deciding where our country heads next.” She’s disappointed that she won’t in fact be among those deciding when the state caucuses next month. “I wish I could be a part of it,” said Ms. Randall, an insurance lawyer. “But I have come to gain a respect for the people of Iowa who take the time to go out and see candidates.” Nebraskans, residents of another Iowa border state, also are stung by neglect this time of year. The feeling is acute in Omaha, a major city of half a million people with Fortune 500 companies, a minor league ballpark and a world-class zoo. It’s just across the Missouri River from Council Bluffs, Iowa, population 62,000, where at least 11 Democratic candidates have visited in past months, some of them twice. Amy Klobuchar visited Omaha, and so did Mr. Castro, when he was in the race. A few candidates have sent surrogates to the city for events. But on a recent evening, the television screen was the place to see presidential candidates as Democrats gathered in a downtown Omaha bar to watch a debate taking place just 130 miles away in Des Moines. Jane Kleeb, chair of the Nebraska Democratic Party, cautioned that Democratic candidates shouldn’t write off her state, which holds its primary in May and which splits its Electoral College votes in the general election. Democrats are making inroads in Omaha, she said. Barack Obama won one electoral vote in 2008, a first for Democrats since the 1960s. “The field is so crowded and voters have been so fluid that we could be that magic deciding factor,” said Ms. Kleeb, who just published a book called “Harvest the Vote: How Democrats Can Win Again in Rural America.” Gladys Harrison is among Nebraska’s Democrats eager for attention not only for her own congressional campaign, which she thinks would benefit from a presidential candidate’s visit, but also for her community. Her Big Mama’s restaurant sits inside a high-ceilinged new cornerstone of a development meant to transform a part of Omaha that residents had long complained was neglected with trendy apartments, a giant green space for outdoor concerts and coding classes for kids. If it were in Iowa, it would be a siren call for any Democratic candidate, she said. The restaurant, started by Ms. Harrison’s mother, each month hosts the Hungry Club, which brings in local politicians, candidates and community organizers to speak before a crowd snacking on cold chicken sandwiches, sweet potato pie and other dishes culled from her family’s 100-year-old recipes. “The Democratic Party has got to continue to send the message out that we’ve got the best candidates that can beat Trump,” Ms. Harrison said. “And everybody needs to hear that message.” PHOTOS: Whimp’s Place, top, in Burbank, S.D.

      "original_text": "The party’s goal is to wrap up the trial on Friday night, though Democrats hinted at a plan to extend it. Republican leaders said they are increasingly confident that the Senate will turn back the Democratic effort to extend the impeachment trial with new witnesses and documents in a Friday vote. Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri, a top Republican leader, said Thursday: “We are getting to where we need to be on the witness vote.” Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming, the No. 3 Republican in the Senate, said his party is pressing to conclude the third impeachment trial in the nation’s history, though he expected Democrats to use procedural gimmicks to try to prevent it. “The goal would be to get this done tomorrow evening,” Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming, the No. 3 Republican in the Senate, told reporters before the second question period in the trial began. “I don’t know if Chuck Schumer has opportunities to try to slow down the process, but I don’t think we end up leaving the Senate floor, leaving the chamber, until it’s done.” A four-hour debate on whether to seek additional witnesses and documents is expected to take place Friday, and Democrats need the support of at least four Republican senators. Several Republican leaders predicted that their party would prevail in blocking the Democratic effort. Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said that he is “getting more optimistic” that they will reject the demand for witnesses and move to a quick conclusion to the trial. He praised Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader. “He’s pretty good at what he does, and I’ve been in the room where people are beginning to consolidate,” Mr. Graham said. Even so, rank-and-file Republican senators emerging from a private luncheon said the leadership was not certain they had the 51 votes necessary to block witnesses. “We don’t know for sure,” Senator Mike Braun, Republican of Indiana.",

      "original_text": "The decisions, in Texas and Louisiana, come as the administration has found itself behind schedule on the president’s promise to build 450 miles of border wall by 2021. WASHINGTON — The White House on Thursday celebrated a federal court ruling that will allow $3.6 billion in military construction funds to be used for the construction of the border wall. A separate court on Thursday lifted a restraining order on a private group allied with President Trump that wants to build its own barriers on private land. The twin rulings buoyed Mr. Trump as his administration has found itself behind schedule on the president’s promise to build 450 miles of border wall by 2021. The decision by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans to lift a lower-court ruling will allow the administration to use the military funds, about a third of the $11 billion that the administration obtained for the barriers, in part by declaring a national emergency and bypassing Congress. Those funds will be used to build 175 miles of barrier in parts of Texas, Arizona and California. A judge in Texas also allowed We Build the Wall, a group led by Mr. Trump’s former adviser, Stephen K. Bannon, to proceed with building barriers along a three-mile stretch along the Rio Grande in Hidalgo County, Texas. The group claims to have raised $25 million in private donations for border wall construction. In a statement on Thursday, the White House applauded as “a victory for the rule of law” the appeals court ruling in New Orleans that lifted an “illegitimate nationwide injunction.” “And in doing so,” the statement said, the court “has allowed vital border wall construction to move forward using military construction funds.” The rulings came as Chad Wolf, the acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, traveled to Yuma, Ariz., to host a news conference on Friday to celebrate the construction of 100 miles of Mr. Trump’s border wall. But the administration still faces an uphill road to completing a campaign promise of the president’s. The Office of Inspector General for the Defense Department is still investigating a $400 million contract for wall construction awarded to Fisher Sand & Gravel, the same company building on the private land in Hidalgo County. The administration has also struggled to gain access to and acquire private land in Texas, where most of the wall’s path runs through. Nearly all of the 100 miles of border wall built by the government crosses federal land. The appeals court in New Orleans overturned a decision by an El Paso judge who ruled that Mr. Trump’s emergency proclamation, which enabled him to obtain the military funds, violated congressional restrictions. In a 2-to-1 decision, the Fifth Circuit ruled that there was a “substantial likelihood” that those challenging the administration, El Paso County and the Border Network for Human Rights, an advocacy group, lacked the standing to sue the administration. The case in Texas involving the privately funded border wall will continue to be litigated, but the judge in the case, Randy Crane, allowed the construction to resume. The National Butterfly Center, a nearby 100-acre nature preserve, sued We Build the Wall in December saying that the construction would harm the surrounding environment. “This wall will have no effect besides that they will destroy vegetation and habitat and while it’s standing it will cause flooding,” said Jeffrey Glassberg, the founder and president of the North American Butterfly Association and a plaintiff in the lawsuit. After celebrating the court’s ruling on Thursday, Brian Kolfage, who founded the campaign to pay for the border wall, was already tweeting videos of construction crews. “They couldn’t prove a single claim in court,” Mr. Kolfage said of the plaintiffs. “It was embarrassing!” PHOTO: Construction for the border wall near Donna, Texas.

      "original_text": "A lawmaker’s push for denser development near transit, overriding local zoning, was thwarted by a diverse group of legislative foes. SAN FRANCISCO — For years, a determined state senator has pushed a singular vision: a bill challenging California’s devotion to both single-family housing and motor vehicles by stripping away limits on housing density near public transit. Now the state will have to look for other ways to relieve its relentless housing crisis. On Thursday, one day before the deadline for action on the hotly debated bill, it failed to muster majority support in a Senate vote. In the end, in a Legislature where consensus can be elusive despite a lopsided Democratic majority, the effort drew opposition from two key constituencies: suburbanites keen on preserving their lifestyle and less affluent city dwellers seeing a Trojan horse of gentrification. The failure marks the third time since 2018 that State Senator Scott Wiener, a San Francisco Democrat and one of the country’s most outspoken advocates for reforming local zoning laws, has tried and failed to push through a major bill meant to stimulate housing production. “This is about Californians who are hurting right now, and we have an obligation to represent them,” Mr. Wiener said in a speech on the Senate floor. The bill’s demise is the latest turn in a long and acrimonious struggle over how much of the answer to California’s most pressing issue lies in rewriting the state’s rules to encourage building. Mr. Wiener’s measure, Senate Bill 50, would have overridden local zoning rules to allow high-density housing near transit lines, high-performing school districts and other amenity-laden areas. Supporters portrayed it as a big but necessary step toward reducing the state’s housing deficit — and helping to curb carbon emissions from long-distance driving — by fostering development in dense urban corridors. Opponents decried it as state overreach into local land-use rules. There is broad agreement that the state’s extraordinary cost of living and escalating homeless problem is rooted in a shortage of housing in general and a dearth of lower-cost housing in particular. But many remain skeptical of remedies involving big structural changes. “The only thing that folks agree on is that we need housing,” said Andreas Borgeas, a Fresno Republican, who voted against the Wiener bill. “How we get there, everyone has a different theory.” Gov. Gavin Newsom, who came into office a year ago with bold pronouncements about a “Marshall Plan for Housing,” said he supported Mr. Wiener’s efforts to increase density near transit, but never endorsed the bill outright. Mr. Newsom campaigned on a promise to usher in reforms that would lead to the construction of 3.5 million housing units by 2025. That output would be more than quadruple the current rate, and the governor has started referring to it as a “stretch goal.” California is not only well behind that pace, but the number of housing permits has actually turned downward — hovering around 100,000 units in 2019 — despite a strong economy and a median home value, $556,000, that is more than twice the national figure. It is hard to overstate the threat posed to the state’s economy and prosperity. Housing costs are the primary reason that California’s poverty rate, 18.2 percent, is the highest of any state when adjusted for its cost of living, despite a thriving economy that has led to strong income growth and record-low unemployment. The consequences are in plain sight. Cities are struggling to deliver basic services because teachers and firefighters can’t afford to live near their jobs. A surge of sidewalk tents and homeless camps has prompted city leaders to urge a state of emergency — and led lucrative business conferences to find other locations. Many Californians are moving to cheaper states, and homelessness routinely tops the polls of residents’ biggest concerns. Liberal and conservative economists agree that the housing squeeze arises in part from an excess of process and local rules. Attempts to reform exclusionary zoning are central to the housing plans of most of the current Democratic presidential candidates, including Senators Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar. The rub is in how to rectify that — and which level of government should take the lead. The answer produced by S.B. 50 was to transfer power from cities to the state. Surprisingly, perhaps, this was an answer that many city officials, frustrated with their own intransigent development processes, endorsed. In addition to supporters like the Natural Resources Defense Council, the payments start-up Stripe and unions including the United Farm Workers, the bill gained the backing of several counties and dozens of elected officials, including Mayors London Breed of San Francisco and Adrian Fine of Palo Alto — both representing cities where development is notoriously expensive and difficult. But their opponents were also a diverse coalition. Take, for instance, Livable California, a group that was formed largely to oppose Mr. Wiener’s bill and others like it. The organization was founded by homeowners in exclusive suburbs in places like Marin County and the San Francisco Peninsula, but also counts activists from Leimert Park, a middle-class and predominantly African-American neighborhood in South Los Angeles, among its members. “Nothing in this bill is giving us more say; it’s taking away what little say we have now,” said Isaiah Madison, a 24-year-old graduate student in Leimert Park who recently joined Livable California’s board. “I’m not against development. I am just for communities navigating that development with a developer. We have community plans in South Los Angeles that we’ve been working on for 30 years that included a lot of input from a community that has historically been underrepresented in urban planning, and I think that’s important to protect.” The road to S.B. 50 began in the previous legislative session, when Mr. Wiener introduced a similar measure that prompted a national conversation about exclusionary land use rules that lead to segregation by income and race. It also tested the degree to which even liberal California voters were ready to embrace higher-density neighborhoods near job centers, an approach that various policymakers and researchers say is crucial to curbing emissions that cause climate change. That bill was killed in its first committee vote in 2018. Mr. Wiener’s office has spent the intervening years modifying it to attract support. Among other things, provisions were added to protect tenants from displacement and to delay implementation for two years to win over cities that said the bill hampered passage of their own housing plans. Though the governor’s office says it still wants a big housing bill like S.B. 50, Mr. Newsom has also declared that zoning reform is useless if cities don’t build in line with state housing plans. To that end, he has pushed an initiative to build affordable housing on public land, pressured cities to accommodate more housing and actually issue permits for what it zones, and signed legislation penalizing cities that don’t meet their state housing goals. The governor also authorized a lawsuit against Huntington Beach, a city of 200,000 in Orange County, for failing to comply with state housing laws, and warned other cities that they faced similar action. While Mr. Wiener has been pushing his zoning bills, the Legislature has passed several less sweeping but potentially significant measures that could add up over time. One prevents cities from changing their zoning laws to reduce future housing, and another that makes it legal to build three units on single-family lots across the state, regardless of local rules. And after Thursday’s vote, the gauntlet was thrown down for further action. “The status quo cannot stand,” Toni Atkins of San Diego, a Senate Democratic leader, told colleagues. Calling on the Legislature to compromise and “step up,” she declared, “A housing production bill will succeed this year.” PHOTO: A commuter train in Oakland, Calif.

      "original_text": "With a deal to sell Berkshire Hathaway’s newspapers to Lee Enterprises, the billionaire is giving up on the news business. Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate run by Warren E. Buffett, announced on Wednesday that it had agreed to sell its 31 newspapers for $140 million in cash. The buyer is Lee Enterprises, the publisher that has been managing the newspaper group’s operations for the past 18 months. Among the organizations being sold are The Buffalo News and a collection of local papers that include The Richmond Times-Dispatch in Virginia. The deal ends Mr. Buffett’s dalliance with being a news mogul. Berkshire had owned The Buffalo News since 1977 and within the past decade rapidly bought up other papers, consolidating them in a division called BH Media Group. In a letter to his newspaper publishers in 2012, Mr. Buffett described himself as a newspaper “addict” with designs on buying more papers. But he grew pessimistic about the business more recently because of drops in advertising revenue. In an interview last year, he said most newspapers were “toast.” Lee also owns newspapers in St. Louis; Tucson, Ariz.; and other markets. “We had zero interest in selling the group to anyone else for one simple reason: We believe that Lee is best positioned to manage through the industry’s challenges,” Mr. Buffett said in a statement. Mr. Buffett will also retain ties to Lee, in a fashion that stays true to his reputation as a master of making money. Berkshire will lend it $576 million, some of which will pay for the newspaper deal, at a 9 percent annual interest rate.

      "original_text": "Tennessee’s combination of power running and a few deep passes does not look particularly modern — but it just might give the Baltimore Ravens a taste of their own medicine. The Tennessee Titans were running the ball toward the sideline — again — which left New England’s defense flowing quickly to its left. It looked like a panel cribbed from a Stan Lee comic: the Titans running back beating all 11 Patriots to the edge, pushing forward with a full head of steam. With his No. 22 jersey perpetually riding up to show a wide swath of his abdomen, and shoulder pads that barely reach his massive arms, Derrick Henry has the look of a running back hit with gamma radiation, suddenly finding himself too big for his equipment, not unlike Lee’s Incredible Hulk. And, in their A.F.C. wild-card game last week, the Patriots appeared to have made him angry. The only thing in Henry’s way on that fourth-quarter play was J.C. Jackson — a fairly large player by defensive back standards, but one who still gives up two inches and almost 50 pounds to the 6-foot-3, 247-pound Henry. Jackson delivered his best attempt at a hit, but Henry knocked him backward and dragged him for nine extra yards, securing the 10th of his 11 first downs on the way to 204 yards from scrimmage in the Titans’ 20-13 upset of New England last week. If you had not been paying attention over the last few months, Tom Brady’s season ending on a wild-card Saturday — to a team that appeared to run the same play on nearly every down — may have been a shock. But to anyone who watched the Titans’ transformation over the final 10 games of the regular season, the result hardly qualified as a surprise. “When you can run it when the other team knows you’re going to run it, that says a lot about your running game,” Coach Mike Vrabel said afterward of Henry, who had dominated the best defense in football on his 26th birthday. Can Henry and the Titans (9-7) deliver another upset, this time in the divisional round of the playoffs against the No. 1-seeded Baltimore Ravens (14-2)? Tennessee is a justifiably large underdog in Saturday’s game, but reaching the divisional round at all is a triumph for a team that looked lost in a 2-4 start to the season. The formula for their success certainly starts with Henry, who built on a legendary high school career — his 12,124 yards for Yulee High School in Florida are still a national record — to win the Heisman Trophy for Alabama in 2015. But progress at the pro level had come in fits and starts for Henry, and to truly unlock his potential and save the team’s season, the Titans did something drastic: They benched Marcus Mariota, the quarterback they had drafted with the No. 2 overall pick in 2015 to be the face of the franchise. Mariota won the Heisman a year before Henry, and tantalized during his first four pro seasons. But he was inconsistent — and sometimes downright bad — over this season’s first six games, and in the third quarter of a Week 6 loss to Denver, Vrabel finally pulled the plug. He was replaced by Ryan Tannehill, who had signed as a backup after seven mediocre seasons in Miami. Tannehill moved the ball with some confidence in that loss and the understated Vrabel shocked plenty of people by quickly naming him the starter for Week 7, saying, “It just felt like now was the time.” The results have proved Vrabel right. With Tannehill as starter, the Titans led all N.F.L. teams in passer rating (119.5), net yards per passing attempt (8.19), and yards per rush (5.64). And that suddenly-potent offense, combined with an opportunistic defense, went 7-3 over its final 10 games, earning the A.F.C.’s second wild-card spot on the final day of the season. Tannehill struggled against New England’s otherworldly secondary last week, and was largely written off as a nonfactor this week by Baltimore safety Earl Thomas, who said the Ravens were mostly preparing for Henry, since trying to pass the ball wouldn’t “go in their favor.” But Tennessee’s symbiotic relationship between quarterback and running back had been undeniably effective during the regular season. Henry went from barely breaking 1,000 rushing yards last season, and only topping 100 yards once in this season’s first six games, to leading the N.F.L. with 1,540 yards and 16 rushing touchdowns. Tannehill, who came into the year with a 42-46 career record and a career passer rating of 87, finished the regular season with the highest rating in the N.F.L. (117.5) and set himself up to potentially cash in on free agency this off-season. And along the way, A.J. Brown, a rookie wide receiver out of Mississippi, developed into one of the game’s premier vertical threats, averaging 20.2 yards a catch and tying Henry for the N.F.L. lead with four touchdowns of 50 or more yards. If there is something striking about Tennessee’s approach (beyond Henry’s ability to wear out a defense), it is the strategy of having Tannehill throw far fewer passes than most of his contemporaries, but making sure each of those passes counts by airing the ball out. Once Tannehill took over under center, the Titans’ offense — led by coordinator Arthur Smith, the son of the FedEx founder Fred Smith — attempted the second-fewest passes per game of any team, but gained the 10th most yards per game through the air. Tannehill’s passes this season traveled an average of 9.7 yards — third-longest in the N.F.L. behind Matthew Stafford and Jameis Winston — but according to the N.F.L.’s NextGen statistics, his 70.3 percent completion rate was an N.F.L.-best 8.1 percentage points higher than he should have been able to produce based on the riskiness of his throws. That combination of a high volume of runs and a few deep passes got more effective as games progressed: The Titans averaged just 10.3 first-half points over the 10 games Tannehill started, but pushed the average to 20.1 in the second half. All of that has led to a matchup against a Ravens team that does many of the same things — often with much more explosive results. Quarterback Lamar Jackson is both a devastating runner and a hyper-efficient passer. Running back Mark Ingram II, who is hoping to come back from a calf injury, can churn through defenses, and wide receiver Marquise Brown can nearly keep up with A.J. Brown in producing highlight-reel touchdowns. No matter who wins, though, the game will serve as proof that teams at the vanguard of the N.F.L.’s offensive revolution do not have to pass the ball on every down to thrive. And while Tennessee may have finally met its match, the Ravens will need to keep their collective foot on the gas all game to avoid the Patriots’ fate. Under Vrabel, the Titans keep playing until the final gun, and any play in which Tannehill, Henry and A.J. Brown are involved has the potential to turn into a touchdown.

      "original_text": "Jeter fell one anonymous vote short of being unanimously elected into the Hall of Fame, but he said he would “focus on the ones who did” name him. Derek Jeter could hardly contain his glee over being elected into the Baseball Hall of Fame. At a news conference in Midtown Manhattan on Wednesday, a day after being elected, Jeter flashed his famous smile almost nonstop and made perhaps as many jokes in a public setting as he has over the last decade combined. Jeter, often guarded in public, poked fun at his former teammate Mariano Rivera, at his father for claiming to be a better shortstop, at Larry Walker’s SpongeBob SquarePants shirt (Walker was wearing it on Tuesday, when he found out that he, too was elected to the Hall of Fame). But there was one shot Jeter would not take, and that was at the lone voter who declined to put Jeter on the Hall of Fame ballot. “I focus on the ones who did,” Jeter said, referring to the 99.7 percent of voters who felt he deserved induction into the Hall of Fame. “It takes a lot of people to all agree to get you to this point. So, I’m not thinking about that.” Jeter received 396 of a possible 397 votes, easily clearing the 75 percent threshold for induction but barely missing out on becoming the second player, after Rivera last year, to be unanimously elected into the Hall of Fame. That one unknown ballot has ignited a firestorm of sorts over who submitted it, and whether the rules should be changed to end anonymous voting. While hundreds of voters opt to make their ballots public every year, it is not required, and many choose to keep their ballots anonymous. One such voter declined to include Jeter. When the subject came up on Wednesday, it created a brief, awkward moment that underscored the hand-wringing over this year’s results. At one point a spokesman for the Hall of Fame said the matter was in the hands of the Baseball Writers Association of America, which is commissioned by the Hall to conduct the vote. But that was not correct, and it prompted Jack O’Connell, the secretary-treasure of the BBWAA, to correct the record. As Jeter and Walker looked on somewhat bewildered, O’Connell clarified that the BBWAA had made a request several years ago to make all the ballots public. But the Hall of Fame denied the request, reasoning that if voters were required to make their votes public, they could be susceptible to outside pressure, preventing them from voting according to their conscience. (The New York Times’s reporters do not vote in the Hall of Fame election.) “They turned that down and said they preferred that the individual decide whether he or she wishes to make the ballot public,” O’Connell said of the Hall. “That’s the option each voter has.” The BBWAA also votes on the yearly player awards, like the Most Valuable Player and Cy Young Awards, and all of those ballots are public. The Hall of Fame debated the merits and pitfalls of the BBWAA’s proposal, but Jane Forbes Clark, the chairwoman of the Hall of Fame, said that they had concluded that anonymous ballots were essential to preserving a free election. And the fervor with which many people have vilified the unknown dissenting voice has not made the Hall of Fame any more inclined to change the process. Clark, who sat on the stage next to Jeter, was asked if the board of directors was comfortable with the current format. “Yes, we are,” she said. But Jeter and Walker were uninterested in the logistics of how they were elected, only that they got in. Jeter learned on Wednesday that his plaque will go next to Rivera’s at the Hall in Cooperstown, N.Y., which is fitting. The two players went through the Yankees minor league system together, made their major league debuts during the same month in 1995, were sent back to the minors on the same day that same year, and played virtually their entire careers alongside one another, except for the lone season, in 2014, that Jeter played after Rivera had retired. “It’s an honor just to be in the Hall of Fame,” Jeter quipped. “I don’t care where they put me. They can put me in the rest room.” Both Jeter and Walker discussed the hardships and trials they faced early in their professional careers after signing as teenagers — Jeter joining the Yankees in 1992 and Walker joining the Montreal Expos in 1984. Walker spent six years with the Expos, parts of 10 seasons with the Colorado Rockies and one and a half with the St. Louis Cardinals. He announced that he would go into the Hall of Fame as a member of the Rockies, in part because of the 258 home runs and 1.044 on-base plus slugging percentage he accumulated with that team. “I spent 10 years in Colorado,” he said, “where the majority of my damage was done.” For Jeter, all his damage was done with the Yankees, over 20 years in which he fulfilled a childhood dream to wear their pinstripes, won five championships, and ultimately compelled 396 writers to send him to Cooperstown. “I’m most proud that I was a Yankee,” he said. “It was the only thing I ever wanted to do as long as I could remember, to play shortstop for the New York Yankees. When it’s all said and done, that’s what I’m most proud of.” PHOTO: Larry Walker, left, and Derek Jeter were all laughs Wednesday as they met the media one day after being elected to the baseball Hall of Fame.

      "original_text": "In a major shift, the Democratic National Committee will eliminate the requirement that candidates to show evidence of grass-roots support. COUNCIL BLUFFS, Iowa — The Democratic National Committee has opened the door to allowing former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York to participate in the presidential debate it will sponsor in Nevada next month, a change from its practice that demanded candidates demonstrate grass-roots fund-raising support. The D.N.C. announced Friday that in order to participate in the debate, set for Feb. 19 in Las Vegas, a candidate must win at least a single delegate in either the Iowa caucuses or the New Hampshire primary or meet polling requirements. It has eliminated the requirement that candidates must have received donations from hundreds of thousands of individuals. Mr. Bloomberg, a multibillionaire, is running a self-funded campaign and is not soliciting donations. The changes, which represent the most significant tightening of debate requirements this cycle, set off a fresh and pointed round of criticism at a critical moment in the race, as several campaigns braced for the reality check that the Iowa caucuses will provide. And the edict from party officials, which some saw as a concession to Mr. Bloomberg, quickly reignited concerns among those who believe the D.N.C.’s shifting rules for the debates privilege some candidates and campaigns over others. To meet the latest polling threshold, candidates must earn 10 percent in four qualifying national polls or 12 percent in two polls taken in Nevada or South Carolina by a qualifying pollster. Mr. Bloomberg, who is not competing in the first four nominating contests, held in those two states, Iowa and New Hampshire, has notched 10 percent in one national poll, which was released by Fox News on Jan. 26. He has until Feb. 18 to perform similarly well in three other national polls. “We are thrilled that voters could soon have the chance to see Mike Bloomberg on the debate stage, hear his vision for the country, and see why he is the strongest candidate to defeat Donald Trump and bring our country together,” Kevin Sheekey, Mr. Bloomberg’s campaign manager, said in a statement. He added, “Mike has run for office three times and never taken a dime from special interests, allowing him to act independently, on the merits, without having to do what donors expect. He is proud to be doing the same with this campaign.” Only former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts have so far met the polling threshold for the Nevada debate. “To now change the rules in the middle of the game to accommodate Mike Bloomberg, who is trying to buy his way into the Democratic nomination, is wrong,” said Jeff Weaver, a senior adviser to Mr. Sanders. “That’s the definition of a rigged system.” Ms. Warren sounded a similar note on Twitter. “The DNC didn’t change the rules to ensure good, diverse candidates could remain on the debate stage. They shouldn’t change the rules to let a billionaire on,” she wrote. “Billionaires shouldn’t be allowed to play by different rules — on the debate stage, in our democracy, or in our government.” Former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, the entrepreneur Andrew Yang and the hedge fund billionaire Tom Steyer, each of whom qualified for next week’s debate in New Hampshire, could still make the one that follows in Nevada by reaching the polling threshold or winning a delegate in the Iowa caucuses or the New Hampshire primary. If they don’t, it would suggest their campaigns faced significant obstacles to continuing. Mr. Buttigieg, speaking in Council Bluffs, said he was fine with the new requirements. “When the initial rules came out with a focus on grass-roots fund-raising, of course our campaign was focused on the same thing,” he told reporters. “Now it sounds like there is a different focus and I do believe that we will qualify.” Tom Perez, the chairman of the D.N.C., signaled in December that he would be willing to alter the debate criteria to allow Mr. Bloomberg to participate once primaries and caucuses began. But he also said then: “Our logic for having a grass-roots fund-raising threshold was, it provides opportunity for people who don’t have the national name I.D. to get on the debate stage. If you want to win the presidency, you’ve got to connect with grass-roots America.” Xochitl Hinojosa, a D.N.C. spokeswoman, argued Friday that the first two nominating contests would adequately measure the grass-roots enthusiasm around a particular candidate, and that the donor threshold was therefore unnecessary. “Now that we will have the results of two elections and grass-roots support is actually captured in voting, that will replace the donor threshold,” she said. During the fall and winter, as the D.N.C. began making it harder to qualify for the debates, some candidates who found themselves short of the thresholds began agitating for more inclusive rules. Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, for example, aired concerns about the diversity of the group that had qualified for the winter debates and led an effort to persuade Mr. Perez to make changes that would expand the roster. Mr. Booker dropped out of the race after failing to qualify for the debates held in December and January. And as it became increasingly likely that he would not qualify for the debate held earlier this month in Iowa, Mr. Yang wrote a letter to Mr. Perez suggesting that the D.N.C. commission more qualifying polls. In a statement posted on Twitter on Friday, S.Y. Lee, a spokesman for Mr. Yang, criticized the rule change, arguing it would help Mr. Bloomberg. “It’s a mistake for @TheDemocrats to change the rules for debates in the middle of this race to yield to a billionaire,” Mr. Lee said. “We need to respect the grass roots movement leading this party forward.” Former members of the Booker campaign underscored just how much of a financial burden the individual donor threshold had placed on campaigns over the summer. Addisu Demissie, who was Mr. Booker’s campaign manager, said on Twitter that one of the most significant days of his campaign was when the donor threshold doubled from 65,000 to 130,000. For a lot of the smaller campaigns, doubling their donor counts was essentially an expense, as buying email lists and running acquisition ads on Facebook replaced other campaign priorities such as digital ads and staffing in early voting states. Jenna Lowenstein, a deputy campaign manager for Mr. Booker, said on Twitter that they had thrown out an entire strategic plan for those states in order to buy email addresses. Mr. Steyer, who argued in December for allowing Mr. Booker and other candidates who missed the polling thresholds onto the debate stage, lamented Friday’s rules change. “Changing the rules now to accommodate Mike Bloomberg and not changing them in the past to ensure a more diverse debate stage is just plain wrong,” he said. “They are changing the rules for a candidate who is ignoring early states’ voters and grass roots donors.” Reid J. Epstein reported from Council Bluffs, and Matt Stevens from New York. Nick Corasaniti contributed reporting. Reid J. Epstein reported from Council Bluffs, and Matt Stevens from New York.

      "original_text": "Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said that the payments to Canadian families of victims do not absolve Iran from providing compensation. OTTAWA — Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said that his government will offer payments to relatives of the dozens of Canadian citizens and permanent residents killed when a Ukrainian airliner was downed by missiles launched by Iranian forces. At a news conference on Friday, Mr. Trudeau said the payments are an interim measure and that Canada will not abandon its efforts to make Iran provide substantial compensation to the families of the victims. He said that Iran bears full responsibility for the incident. “I want to be clear: we expect Iran to compensate these families,” Mr. Trudeau said. “But I have met them, they can’t wait weeks. They need support now.” Canada will provide each of the families with 25,000 Canadian dollars, about $19,000, to cover the cost of funerals and travel. The prime minister said that 57 of the victims were Canadian citizens and another 29 were permanent residents of the country. Canada does not have diplomatic relations with Iran and relies on Italy as its representative there. Members of Canada’s Transportation Safety Board are participating in the investigation that Iran is leading into the downing. For three days, Iran claimed that the airplane, Ukrainian International Airlines Flight 752, had crashed due to mechanical problems, despite the findings of various intelligence services that the plane was shot down. Iran then reversed its denial, admitting that a member of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps — a powerful, hard-line military force — mistook the plane for a cruise missile. Videos verified by The New York Times indicate that two missiles struck the airliner before it crashed. In the week since the disaster, Mr. Trudeau and several senior members of his cabinet have been crisscrossing the country to meet with relatives of the victims and attend public vigils. The prime minister has stayed out of a growing debate within the country over whether President Trump shares some of the responsibility for the deaths by creating a volatile situation in Iran that some argue led to the downing. Canada expects the first remains of victims to arrive soon, Mr. Trudeau said. He also urged Iran to send the damaged cockpit voice and flight data recorders from the airliner to France for downloading and analysis.

      "original_text": "The war in Afghanistan has taken so much from the poet Zaheer Ahmad Zindani. His mother was determined to ensure it wouldn’t take his chance to marry. KANDAHAR, Afghanistan — The young poet sat in the barber’s chair, facing a giant mirror on the wall that he could not see. The poet was Zaheer Ahmad Zindani, and this was the eve of his wedding. The war in Afghanistan had taken many things from him: his eyes, his father, his sister, his first love. But he had a chance at a new beginning, preparing to marry a woman his mother had worked tirelessly to find. “Make it so no matter which of the four directions I comb, it looks good,” Mr. Zindani told the barber. The narrow alleys and matchbox houses in his neighborhood of Kandahar City, in southern Afghanistan, were dark. Electricity had been patchy since the Taliban blew up a cable that fed power to the city. Despite that, he was busy entertaining relatives. Leading the celebrations for the big day last month was his mother, Bibi Sediqa, the anchor of a family devastated at every turn, drawing on all her strength to keep it together and stay hopeful. Late into the evening, she and a group of women took Mr. Zindani to the bride’s for a traditional henna party where the couple painted little full moons in each other’s palms. The next evening, she was in the front seat of the car that brought the bride to her new home. “This was my first real happiness in life,” Ms. Sediqa said after the wedding. In a deeply conservative and patriarchal society in which many women are kept out of the public eye, even Ms. Sediqa, who is the main breadwinner for her family, did not want to be pictured for this article and was reluctant to be interviewed. She said she was married at 14. In the early years of the United States-led invasion, an American airstrike killed her husband in their home district of Gereshk, in Helmand. She was 26 and left with three young daughters and two sons. Zaheer was 7. Relocating to Chaman, a border area with Pakistan, she cooked and cleaned in Pakistani homes to feed her children. Her young boys each worked for small change as mechanic’s apprentices in Afghanistan. Zaheer was in love with a childhood friend, their teenage romance blossoming with gift exchanges and sneaky dates. Then, another tragedy. As Zaheer, 17, and a younger sister were traveling to visit relatives in western Herat Province, their bus hit a Taliban roadside bomb. She burned to death; Zaheer was left blind. Ms. Sediqa rushed him to hospital after hospital — in Kabul, in the Pakistani city of Karachi, and even in India years later when she had saved enough. “They said the nerve-endings in the eyes are finished,” Ms. Sediqa said. Ms. Sediqa moved the family to Kandahar City. For a couple of years, she worked as a polio vaccinator, going door to door to give drops. At night she took classes, resuming an education that had been disrupted when she was in third grade. These days, Ms. Sediqa has a day job as a literacy instructor, traveling to villages to teach adults how to read and write. She continues her own education at night. (Just before the wedding, she completed her 11th-grade exams.) After Mr. Zindani returned home from a grueling and poignant peace march against violence that captured the country’s attention, he and his younger brother sold blocks of ice. Mr. Zindani’s urge to get married, and urgently, was as much out of a hurt. The family of his teenage love rejected him after he was blinded, marrying the girl to someone else. He was determined to prove that blindness was not the end. But convincing any family to marry their daughter to a blind man was tough work, and it fell on Ms. Sediqa. She knocked on as many as 18 doors, Mr. Zindani said. “They would all say, ‘We would happily agree if he hadn’t been blind,’” Mr. Zindani recalled. “My mother would say, ‘His eyes will be fixed.’ They would say, ‘Come back when they are fixed.’” Ms. Sediqa had not given up hope that her son’s eyes would be fixed, going so far as to sell jewelry, borrow money and fly to Kabul to pay for a solution that turned out to be a scam. During her vaccination work, Ms. Sediqa met Sima, a woman in her early 20s who was teaching children Quranic studies at her home. Ms. Sediqa would stop by to give the children polio drops. She grew to like Sima, and started talking to Sima’s family. After more than a dozen visits over a year, Sima’s parents said yes. Mr. Zindani’s disability was not much of an issue, they said, as long as he had good character and proved he could take care of a new family. Mr. Zindani’s assurance: He possessed a disability benefits card, and his family owned a lot of land back in their village in Gereshk. Once the Taliban were gone, they could make use of that land again. Sima’s parents said she had consented. But before a final nod, Sima’s mother and sister came over to Mr. Zindani’s home for one last conversation with the future groom. “They wanted to make sure I would be nice to their daughter, that I would respect her rights, that I wouldn’t be abusive,” Mr. Zindani said. “Both my mother and I told them since I am disabled and they are being generous with me, I will treat her as my crown.” On the wedding day, a small convoy of cars set off from Mr. Zindani’s home to the bride’s, snaking through Kandahar’s streets as an excited 14-year-old drummer provided a soundtrack from the back of a three-wheeler. Mr. Zindani seemed happy and excited, too. He said that what remained of his previous love, and the heartbreak of it, was now largely limited to poetic inspiration. He recited one of his latest verses: I came to this alley to ask about my love I wander in ruins; I hoped she hears my sigh. He said that he was stuck with images of his life before he went blind; since the bombing he is unable to visualize new acquaintances. “Love with open eyes — when you have fallen in love with someone you have seen — is different with that of closed eyes,” Mr. Zindani said. “When you can’t see the person, the thirst is not fulfilled the same.” At Sima’s house, the men were led to the veranda of an open-air mosque and the women into her home. The men sipped orange soda as the sun set while the women’s voices, singing to a simple hand drum called a daf, echoed through the neighborhood. The ceremony ended in about an hour, with a prayer by a local imam who wished the newlyweds eternal love — “the kind between the Prophet Muhammad and his wife Khadija.” As the bride made her way out of her parents’ home and into the car adorned in flowers, Mr. Zindani’s friends danced in celebration in front of it. The young drummer played a simple rhythmic beat in the dim light of the moon. When the convoy returned to Mr. Zindani’s house with the bride, the women, still singing and playing their daf, took her inside to her throne where the party would continue into the night. Mr. Zindani stayed outside, in the dark alley, as his friends continued to dance. One friend spun and spun and spun, until the young drummer’s hands tired and he signaled its end. “I wish I could see it,” Mr. Zindani said. “But my heart is happy.” PHOTOS: Zaheer Ahmad Zindani getting his hair cut for his wedding in Kandahar, Afghanistan; The bride, Sima, covered by a white veil, entering the wedding car at the mosque.; Sima, the bride, covered with a white veil, entering the wedding car outside the mosque.; “Both my mother and I told them since I am disabled and they are being generous with me, I will treat her as my crown,” Mr. Zindani said; Mr. Zindani’s friends dancing outside his house, in the dark alley, as a young drummer played a simple rhythmic beat in the dim light of the moon.

Regular viewers of Senate proceedings will likely notice something very odd when debate begins: Senators will not be doing the debating themselves. Because the rules of the trial require senators to remain silent at virtually all times, the motions made by either side will be debated by the House managers and the White House lawyers instead. That leaves the normally loquacious senators in quite a bind. No matter how strongly they feel about their motions, there will be no fist-pounding or stirring speeches in an attempt to convince their colleagues. At least, not by them.",

      "original_text": "Severe heat and dry skies have given way to strong thunderstorms in the country’s southeast, where giant hailstones destroyed cars. It was the latest wild turn in this most extreme of Australian summers. Large hailstones have rained down on Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra over the past two days, destroying vehicles, punching holes in roofs and blanketing the lawn in front of Parliament. Suddenly, a season of suffocating heat, bone-dry skies and voracious fires has given way in southeastern Australia to widespread thunderstorms. Skies once darkened by smoke are now brooding with clouds and rain — at least for a few days. Hailstones were as large as baseballs. Wind gusts topped 70 miles per hour. In some areas, an inch of rain fell in just 30 minutes. A few places experienced flash flooding. Thousands of people were left without power. But other images from the region, including a wall of dust that swept rural New South Wales, offered a dramatic reminder that Australia’s drought — and the devastating wildfires it has fed — are far from over. The rain began late last week, delighting Australians seeking solace after a year that was the hottest and driest on record. The actor Russell Crowe shared images on Twitter of his farm in New South Wales, which had been ravaged by fire but was now turning green. Dozens of fires are still burning, some out of control, in New South Wales and Victoria. In Canberra, emergency workers who had been preparing to fight fires were ordered back to the city after more than 1,000 homes lost power. In the northeastern state of Queensland, 19,000 customers lost electricity because of high winds. Two tourists climbing a metal staircase in the Blue Mountains were struck by lightning, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported. Both were in a hospital in stable condition. The Bureau of Meteorology warned that the storms would continue for the next few days. Hot and windy conditions are expected to return to many parts of New South Wales later this week.

      "original_text": "A cabinet secretary, a House committee chairman and an inspector general are at odds after a congressional staff member said she was sexually assaulted. WASHINGTON — Federal authorities have declined to file charges after a House staff member said she was sexually assaulted at the Department of Veterans Affairs hospital in Washington, setting up a highly unusual public confrontation among a cabinet secretary, a congressional committee chairman and an inspector general. In September, Andrea Goldstein, a Navy veteran and the senior policy adviser for the Women Veterans Task Force on the House Veterans Affairs Committee, said she was assaulted on Sept. 20 while buying a snack at the medical center’s cafeteria. Ms. Goldstein, who works on the sexual assault issue for the committee, said a man slammed his body against hers below the waist and told her that “you look like you could use a good time,” Ms. Goldstein said in an interview. “He pressed his entire body against mine,” she added. Her complaint was investigated by the V.A. Office of Inspector General at the direction of the Veterans Affairs secretary, Robert Wilkie, as well as law enforcement officials, who declined to bring any charges this week. According to committee officials, video cameras at the hospital that might have captured the episode were not working, impeding the investigation. The complaint underscored a major problem for many V.A. hospitals across the country trying to draw female veterans — the largest growing segment of the veteran population — even as many of them report harassment and worse at the agency’s centers. Representative Mark Takano, Democrat of California and the chairman of the Veterans Affairs Committee, had written a letter to Mr. Wilkie at the time of the complaint seeking an arrest. This week, in a letter to Mr. Takano, Mr. Wilkie said he had spoken to the inspector general, Michael J. Missal, and concluded that Mr. Takano had made “unsubstantiated claims” about the case. “We believe that V.A. is a safe place for all veterans to enter and receive care and services, but the unsubstantiated claims raised by you and your staff could deter our veterans from seeking the care they need and deserve,” Mr. Wilkie said in the letter. In an equally unusual rebuke, Mr. Missal then wrote to Mr. Wilkie saying that characterizing Ms. Goldstein’s allegation as unsubstantiated was incorrect. “Neither I nor my staff told you or anyone else at the department that the allegations were unsubstantiated,” Mr. Missal wrote. “Reaching a decision to close the investigation with no criminal charges does not mean that the underlying allegation is unsubstantiated.” Mr. Takano, in his own response, called Mr. Wilkie’s letter “shockingly tone-deaf” and “outrageous.” “When my staffer bravely came forward in September, she did so in the spirit of wanting other women veterans to feel safe,” Mr. Takano said in the statement. “But the secretary’s flippant letter is only further evidence to my staffer and others that coming forward is punished, speaking out retaliated against, and that a hostile culture at V.A. is tolerated.” A survey conducted by the department last year found that one in four female veterans reported harassment from other veterans at V.A. facilities.

      "original_text": "An investigation that began in the pages of The Times becomes a criminal case in a courtroom. Certain stories demand our attention, over and over. That’s how we feel about the story of Harvey Weinstein. Today’s episode about his criminal trial in Manhattan, which began this week, marks the eighth time we’ve devoted a show to the subject. From the beginning, the story of Weinstein, the allegations against him of a pattern of sexual misconduct and the system that facilitated it — which became the subject of a Pulitzer Prize-winning line of coverage in The Times by our colleagues Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey — has sent shockwaves across the United States and the world. It ignited a social movement and forced a social and political reckoning over sex, power and accountability that is still playing out. Our coverage began in the fall of 2017 with Jodi and Megan’s original investigation, which they laid out in detail on the show. The episode introduced Weinstein to listeners — a prominent, wealthy and well-connected Hollywood figure accused of serially abusing women in the entertainment industry. Next, we explored the impact of Megan and Jodi’s investigation, which prompted dozens of new accusers to come forward, including a woman named Katherine Kendall, who told us her harrowing story on the show. Soon after, when the actress Ashley Judd, another Weinstein accuser, filed a lawsuit against Weinstein — not for sexual misconduct, but for the damage he did to her career — we looked at the economic toll of sexual harassment and whether the law sufficiently protects against it. As Megan and Jodi’s reporting deepened, we examined the apparatus of complicity around Weinstein that allegedly allowed him to repeatedly abuse women, year after year, without legal or, seemingly, professional consequence. Then, as Megan and Jodi finished a book about Weinstein that brought new revelations about his conduct, we explored a lesser-told part of the story: the role of the famous feminist mother-and-daughter lawyers Gloria Allred and Lisa Bloom in reinforcing the legal system that many people believe kept Weinstein’s conduct secret for so long. Finally, as Weinstein’s trial began in New York, we turned to Jodi and Megan for two more episodes, which ran yesterday and today, that explained why a case that involved more than 80 accusers had turned into a criminal trial with just two plaintiffs. Now, as the trial gets underway and an investigation that began in the pages of The Times becomes a criminal case in a courtroom, we encourage you to revisit those episodes, especially if you missed them the first time around, for a look at how the Weinstein case unfolded. As for us, we will continue to cover the story as urgently as ever. Talk to Michael on Twitter: @mikiebarb. Welcome back This week, after scattering to the four corners of the earth over the holidays, our producers returned to the office with a surprising unity of mind: On ‘The Daily’ this week Monday: Helene Cooper on the killing of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani: What the administration “will have to answer to the American people,” she tells us, “is whether or not this assassination was worth it.” Tuesday: “What we’ve seen is that the U.S. has effectively turned General Suleimani into a martyr.” Farnaz Fassihi looks at Iran’s reaction to the death of its most powerful military commander. Wednesday: John Bolton, the former national security adviser, said he would be willing to testify in the impeachment trial. Will the Senate let him do it? We asked Julie Hirschfeld Davis. Thursday: Law enforcement pressured Lucia Evans to cooperate in the case they were building against Harvey Weinstein. Then they dropped her from the case. Friday: In Part 2 of our Weinstein story, Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey explain why, after more than 80 women came forward with allegations of sexual misconduct against the film producer, the criminal charges he’s facing in New York center on just two.

      "original_text": "Europe’s new trade commissioner arrived in Washington on Monday on a mission to prevent the Trump administration from ruining the European economy. But with trans-Atlantic relations already at a low point, Phil Hogan, a blunt-talking, physically imposing Irishman, will probably do well if he can simply prevent things from going any further downhill. As Mr. Hogan begins a four-day visit, his first as trade commissioner, the list of reasons for the United States and Europe to be angry at each other is long and getting longer. The United States, upset at France’s plans to tax technology companies, is threatening tariffs that would double the price of imported French wine. The European Union accuses the administration of paralyzing the system for resolving trade disputes, ushering in an era of conflict and disorder. Punishing tariffs on European steel and aluminum remain in place. The administration continues to dangle the threat of duties on European cars, which would be economically devastating for the Continent. Europeans are deeply alarmed by what they regard as the president’s recklessness in the Middle East. “The current state of E.U.-U.S. relations isn’t good, and I don’t think it’s likely to get better anytime soon,” said Peter Chase, senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund of the United States in Brussels. Mr. Hogan brings a different set of skills than Cecilia Malmstrom, whom he succeeded as the European Union’s top trade official at the beginning of December. Some in Brussels think his rawer style will make him a better match for the current occupant of the White House. Mr. Hogan recently said, for example, that by leaving the European Union, the British people were trading in a Rolls-Royce for a used sedan. The statement was seen as particularly cheeky coming from an Irishman who will also be responsible for negotiating a trade deal with Britain as part of its withdrawal from the European Union, a herculean task. “He is more direct,” said Luisa Santos, the director for international relations at BusinessEurope, an industry group. Gender may also play a role, Ms. Santos said. There is a widespread perception in Washington and Brussels that Trump officials were not comfortable with Ms. Malmstrom, an assertive Swede. “He is probably the right person for this moment,” Ms. Santos said. But it’s unclear whether Mr. Hogan, who declined requests for an interview, will have any more success than Ms. Malmstrom at repairing the largest trade partnership in the world, worth $1 trillion a year. His agenda includes meetings with Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative; Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary; and Wilbur Ross, the secretary of commerce. To varying degrees, all support the president’s hard line on trade relations. On Tuesday, there was a sign that the United States and Europe were still capable of cooperating. Mr. Hogan, Mr. Lighthizer and Kajiyama Hiroshi, the Japanese minister of economy, trade and industry, said in a joint statement that they would work together to tighten international rules on government subsidies and forced transfer of technology. The statement was clearly aimed at China, which is often accused of propping up its companies to give them an unfair advantage over foreign competitors, and of forcing foreign companies to share sensitive technology in return for permission to operate in China. The three countries also agreed to work together to reform the World Trade Organization, a key objective of the Europeans. A 6-foot-5 former farmer from Kilkenny in southern Ireland, Mr. Hogan spent much of his political career in the trenches of Irish domestic politics, helping to build the centrist Fine Gael party into Ireland’s strongest bloc. He was Fine Gael’s director of organization in the early 2000s, and later head of the party’s national election campaign. “Phil knew every candidate, he knew every constituency,” said Ciaran Conlon, a former Fine Gael spokesman who is now director of public policy for Microsoft in Ireland. Mr. Hogan’s feel for retail politics served him well, Mr. Conlon said, when he later became the European commissioner responsible for agriculture, the job he held until December. Mr. Hogan organized town meetings with farmers around Europe, and attended funerals of prominent farm leaders. His approach helped to combat the European Commission’s reputation for aloofness. “Politics is about personal relationships, and Phil understands that,” Mr. Conlon said. As agriculture commissioner, Mr. Hogan was often involved in trade talks, and gained a reputation for being canny and well prepared. Farm products are typically the most politically sensitive component of trade deals. A plan to reach a more comprehensive trans-Atlantic trade deal early on in Mr. Trump’s tenure fell apart over disagreements about how to address agriculture. “He’s a very, very good negotiator,” said Sorin Moisa, a former member of the European Parliament from Romania and former European trade official. Ms. Malmstrom managed to prevent the president from carrying through on a threat to penalize European car imports, which would be devastating for the Continent’s economy. But little remains of the optimism that followed a meeting in July 2018 between Mr. Trump and Jean-Claude Juncker, then the president of the European Commission. The two men said they would work to reduce tariffs to zero and eliminate regulations that hindered trans-Atlantic trade. The European Union and the United States are each other’s largest trading partner, and there is general agreement that both sides would benefit from lower trade barriers. Progress has been modest at best. In July, they agreed to recognize each other’s inspections of factories that produce pharmaceuticals. The agreement eliminates the need for duplicate inspections and should cut the cost of drug production. But in most other ways, the relationship has only turned more sour. The Europeans accuse the United States of crippling the W.T.O. by blocking appointments of new members to a crucial panel that hears appeals in trade disputes. The panel effectively ceased to function in December when several members’ terms expired. Without a system to enforce trade rules, Mr. Hogan told members of the European Parliament last year, “Well, then, there isn’t any point in having agreements.” “We have asked the U.S. to engage with us, and they have refused to do so,” he said. As the norms that have governed world trade crumble, countries are responding to disputes with tit-for-tat retaliation and displays of power. After France said it would impose a so-called digital tax on technology companies — a measure clearly aimed at Silicon Valley — the United States threatened 100 percent tariffs on French wine, handbags, cookware and other products. “When sides take unilateral actions that harm the other side, that are inconsistent with international norms, the other side has a right to be angry,” said Clete Willems, a partner at the law firm Akin Gump who was an economic adviser in the White House until last year. “That’s where we are with the E.U. now.” There is plenty of ire to go around. The Europeans are angry at the United States for imposing sanctions on companies helping to build the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline between Russia and Germany. Both sides are mad about what they say are illegal subsidies to their flagship aircraft manufacturers. The United States is putting $7.5 billion in tariffs on European products in retaliation for illegal aid to Airbus, and the Europeans are expected to retaliate in kind for what they say are illegal subsidies to Boeing. Mr. Hogan will try to convince his American counterparts that Europe and the United States should work together to rein in China, in part by fixing the W. T.O. He also plans meetings on Capitol Hill, where his Irish-ness is likely to play well. Nobody is expecting a major breakthrough, but there is some hope that the trip could signal the start of a gradual improvement in the trade relationship. “I don’t think either side wants this to go back into a deep hole again and spiral into negativity,” said Susan Danger, chief executive of the American Chamber of Commerce to the European Union. “Both sides want to kick off in a positive way.” Ana Swanson contributed reporting.

      "original_text": "Ms. Williamson, a self-help author and spiritual adviser who ran for president, had viral debate moments but drew fire for her comments on science and medicine. Marianne Williamson, the self-help author and spiritual adviser whose long-shot presidential campaign called for reparations and a Department of Peace, announced on Friday that she would drop out of the race. “I stayed in the race to take advantage of every possible opportunity to share our message,” Ms. Williamson said in a message to supporters. “With caucuses and primaries now about to begin, however, we will not be able to garner enough votes in the election to elevate our conversation any more than it is now.” She added that, in a race as tight as this one, she did not want to “get in the way of a progressive candidate winning” any caucus or primary. Ms. Williamson, 67, built her campaign around an eclectic mix of progressive policies and lofty pronouncements. President Trump’s election was a symptom of a spiritually diseased society, she said, and only love, not plans, could defeat him. “Mr. President, if you’re listening, I want you to hear me, please: You have harnessed fear for political purposes, and only love can cast that out,” she declared from the debate stage in June. “I’m going to harness love for political purposes. I will meet you on that field, and sir, love will win.” Ms. Williamson was averaging less than 1 percent in polls and had not qualified for a debate since July. Earlier this month, she laid off her entire staff — a development first reported by New Hampshire’s WMUR television station and confirmed by Ms. Williamson’s campaign manager, Patricia Ewing, who was among those laid off. At that July debate, she gave forceful responses to two questions about race — describing reparations not as “financial assistance” but rather “payment of a debt that is owed,” and saying the water crisis in Flint, Mich., would never have happened in a wealthy, majority-white suburb — and got a brief surge of public attention. But her poll numbers did not budge, and the spotlight also brought renewed scrutiny of her views on science and medicine. Earlier in the year, she had called vaccine mandates “Orwellian,” then backtracked under fire. She also criticized the widespread use of antidepressants, linking them without evidence to celebrity suicides and asserting that doctors recklessly prescribe them to suppress ordinary emotions. In an interview with The New York Times over the summer, she said she had been wrong to call clinical depression a “scam,” but stood by other remarks that mental health experts warned could increase the stigma surrounding mental illness and discourage people from seeking medical help. Ms. Williamson’s presidential campaign was only her second foray into politics, after an unsuccessful congressional bid in California in 2014. But she is famous in the self-help and New Age communities, having written multiple New York Times best-sellers and been a spiritual adviser to Oprah. She opened the Los Angeles and Manhattan Centers for Living in the 1980s to support people with H.I.V. and AIDS at a time when they were often ostracized, and also founded Project Angel Food, which provides free meals to people with serious illnesses. In addition to her call for $200 billion to $500 billion in reparations for slavery, a central component of Ms. Williamson’s platform was her proposed Department of Peace. Essentially, such a department would have expanded and strengthened the State Department’s peace-building agencies. Ms. Williamson said it would work to prevent wars and to reduce violence within the United States, including shootings and domestic terrorism. In her message to supporters, Ms. Williamson said that she would back the eventual Democratic nominee, no matter who it is: “I will be there with all my energy and in full support.” “Things are changing swiftly and dramatically in this country, and I have faith that something is awakening among us,” she wrote. “A politics of conscience is still yet possible. And yes … love will prevail.” PHOTO: Marianne Williamson’s presidential campaign was only her second foray into politics, after an unsuccessful congressional bid in California in 2014.

      "original_text": "A desire not to offend potential customers in a divided nation, as well as wariness of President Trump’s Twitter account, means fewer topical ads. At this point in the 2016 election cycle Donald J. Trump was slashing through a field of more seasoned candidates and Hillary Clinton appeared to have a good shot at becoming the first female president. Americans were transfixed, and a number of advertising campaigns capitalized on the growing interest in an unusual race. A Chrysler commercial starred a pair of actors known for their portrayals of fictional White House occupants: Martin Sheen (President Jed Bartlet of “The West Wing”) and Bill Pullman (President Thomas Whitmore of “Independence Day”). An ad for Legal Sea Foods, a restaurant chain based in Boston, presented the company’s chief executive, Roger Berkowitz, in a mock campaign poster with a slogan that referenced a Trump campaign promise: “If we build a wall on the border, who will eat our delicious fish tacos?” Four years later, things have changed. The environment for advertising is “more scary than exciting,” said Ellis Verdi, the president of DeVito/Verdi, the agency that created the Legal Sea Foods ad, and most companies no longer see an upside in weighing in on politics, even jokingly. “There’s fear, as opposed to the entertainment that was associated with the horse race a couple of years ago,” Mr. Verdi said. “Even free expression is a challenge right now. People are holding their hands over their eyes and ears a little bit. This is not the moment for advertisers to take risks.” With impeachment in the news and the 2020 campaign inspiring nasty hashtags on social media, it has become routine for companies to reject pitches for ads that even touch on politics. They have also asked that their ads be placed far from candidates’ campaign spots. “It’s like McCarthyism — people are too frickin’ scared to say anything,” said Gaston Legorburu, a longtime advertising executive who founded the agency Glue IQ. “I’ve seen briefs where on Page 1 they’re telling you to, by all means, stay away from anything that is political.” In the digital sphere, companies are taking steps to make sure that their ads do not appear next to content that includes keywords like “Russia,” “Ukraine” and “election,” according to data compiled by the technology company Integral Ad Science. “Impeachment” is another no-no. In December 2018, few companies blocked that word. A year later, nearly 50 companies had done so. Some brand executives have told ad agencies that they are afraid of alienating customers or drawing the wrath of the presidential Twitter account. “It’s a divided world that we live in,” said Raja Rajamannar, the chief marketing officer at Mastercard. “Can you afford to exclude half of your audience?” Other companies are avoiding politically engaged ads out of simple fatigue. “Trump has been in America’s 24-hour news cycle for the past four years: countless hours of ‘Saturday Night Live’ skits, tweets, memes, #resistance microsites, etc.,” Zachary Roif, an associate creative director at the marketing agency R/GA, said in an email. “People have simply had enough — enough outrage, enough disdain, enough shock value to the point where making a statement feels a little tired.” And then there is the risk of offending Mr. Trump and how that could affect business. “This notion that you pick on a president and then he tweets about you and is mean to your company is a new thing,” said Eamonn Store, the chief executive of the consulting firm FairShare and a former North American chief executive of Guardian News & Media. “If you happen to be a large technology brand like Microsoft, and the government is your biggest client, then the last thing you need is to be in conflict with the White House.” Many companies, Mr. Store added, believe Mr. Trump will win re-election. If that happens, he said, “being the pro-impeachment enterprise is not going to be good for business.” The president has railed against Amazon, Google and Harley-Davidson. When Nike announced in 2018 that it had entered into a new marketing deal with the former N.F.L. quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who had angered the administration by kneeling during the national anthem to protest police brutality and racism, Mr. Trump said on Twitter, “Nike is getting absolutely killed with anger and boycotts.” Things are different on the other side of the Atlantic. Before the fractious general election in Britain last month, Burger King put up an ad on the sides of a double-decker bus featuring a photo of a burger and the tagline “Another Whopper on the side of a bus. Must be an election.” The British supermarket chain Tesco commented cheekily on the political discord with an advertisement showing bottles of liquor crowded around the words “Time for a cabinet reshuffle.” This is the kind of advertising — politically engaged, cheerfully flippant — that is not making the rounds in the United States. In recent years companies have been willing to associate themselves with broad messages on social issues, using ads to support female empowerment, the environment and other causes that do not raise many hackles. But the specifics of 2020 seem too hot to touch. “It just feels wrong right now,” Mr. Verdi said. PHOTOS: Politically themed ads were common in the last election cycle, as in a Chrysler commercial starring Martin Sheen, above center, and Bill Pullman, but the mood has changed since President Trump’s election.

      "original_text": "Some in Canada worry that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex could be expensive to protect. MONTREAL — News from Queen Elizabeth II on Monday that Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, will be living part-time in Canada was greeted with a mix of enthusiasm and concern that Canada could end up faced with a hefty bill for hosting them. Philippe Lagassé, an expert on the monarchy at Carleton University, said that although monarchists and celebrity watchers will be happy, others could be annoyed if Canada ended up having to foot the cost for their security. There was also a camp of people consumed by “indifference,” he added. “People who care about the monarchy and celebrity will view this in a good light,” he said. “Now the question will be who is going to pay the tab for the security bill.” [Update: Lawyers for Harry and Meghan have sent a letter to British some British news outlets over photos.] One reader commented on the website of The Globe and Mail, Canada’s leading national newspaper: “Welcome to Canada but I trust you will be paying for any security or other costs. You cannot benefit from your royal station.” The sentiment was echoed by other readers. Bill Morneau, Canada’s finance minister, told reporters on Monday that the government had not yet decided if it would cover some of the security costs related to the royal move. “No, we haven’t spent any time thinking about this issue,” he was quoted as saying by the CBC, the Canadian broadcaster. “We obviously are always looking to make sure, as a member of the Commonwealth, we play a role. We have not had any discussions on that subject at this time.” While the royal couple have professed to wanting to be financially independent, there is no guarantee they could get permits to work in Canada. Speaking before Monday’s announcement, Professor Lagassé noted that, although the queen is Prince Harry’s grandmother and is an enduring presence on the Canadian 20-dollar bill, she was not a Canadian citizen and that her status as Canada’s head of state did not automatically confer legal rights to her grandson. He added that while Canada is a constitutional monarchy and there was little enthusiasm for upending its constitutional structure, the setup was nevertheless viewed by many as a vestige of the past. “If you were to remake Canada now it wouldn’t be a monarchy,” he said. “At the moment, the royal family don’t live here or cost us anything. But if they did, then attitudes toward them could change.” The office of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau declined to comment. In December, around the time of the couple’s Canadian vacation, he had extended them a warm welcome on Twitter. “You’re among friends, and always welcome here,” he wrote.

      "original_text": "If you follow space news and astronomy, the past year offered no shortage of highlights. Astronomers provided humanity’s first glimpse of a black hole. China landed on the moon’s far side. And the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing inspired us to look ahead to our future in space. The year to come will be no less eventful: No fewer than four missions to Mars could leave Earth this summer. NASA may finally launch astronauts into orbit aboard capsules built by SpaceX and Boeing. We expect to learn more secrets about the interstellar comet Borisov. And private companies are working to demonstrate new abilities in space. However much you love space and astronomy, it can be challenging to keep up with the latest news in orbit and beyond. That’s why we’ve put dates for some of these events on The Times’s Astronomy and Space Calendar, which has been updated for 2020. Subscribe on your personal digital calendar to be automatically synced with our updates all year long. (We promise not to collect any personal information from your private calendar when you sign up.) [Sync your calendar with the solar system.] Below are some of the launches, space science and other events to look forward to. A crowd heads to Mars Roughly every two years, the orbits of Earth and Mars come closer than usual. Space agencies on Earth often send missions to the red planet during that window, and in 2020 four such launches are scheduled. Three of the missions will carry rovers. The United States is launching the soon-to-be-renamed Mars 2020 rover, which also carries a small helicopter. It will try to land in Jezero Crater, which once contained a lake and could preserve evidence of life, if life ever existed there. Neither China, Europe nor Russia has deployed a rover on the Martian surface. But they will try, in a pair of missions. China’s mission, its first on its own to the red planet, includes an orbiter in addition to a rover. The European Space Agency and Russia cooperated to build Rosalind Franklin, a rover named for the English chemist whose work was essential to finding the structure of DNA. The rovers could be joined on Mars by Hope, an orbiter commissioned by the United Arab Emirates. It is being built in Colorado, and is to be launched on a Japanese rocket. If it succeeds, it could represent a new model for space programs, of small, wealthy countries getting into orbit and beyond. Renewed human spaceflight from the United States Since the space shuttle’s last flight, in 2011, NASA has relied on Russia’s Soyuz spacecraft for trips to and from the International Space Station. In 2019, NASA hoped to begin flying astronauts aboard capsules built by two private companies, SpaceX and Boeing, but persistent delays knocked back the timeline another year. NASA’s commercial crew program could finally achieve its goal in 2020. SpaceX’s Crew Dragon is scheduled to conduct an uncrewed test of its in-flight abort system on Jan. 11. If the test succeeds, the capsule could carry astronauts to the space station not long after. Boeing’s Starliner experienced problems during its first uncrewed test flight in December and was unable to dock with the space station. An upcoming review of that test will determine whether Starliner might still be able to fly into orbit with astronauts in the first half of this year. Private spaceflight seeks new heights Virgin Galactic, the space-plane company run by Richard Branson, conducted two successful test flights with crew aboard in the past 13 months. In the year to come, the company could carry its first passengers to the edge of space. Blue Origin, the company founded by Jeff Bezos of Amazon, may follow suit; it has conducted 12 crewless tests of its capsule for short tourist jumps to suborbital space. For now, only the very wealthy will be able to afford such jaunts. Other private companies are looking to Earth orbit for the future of internet service. SpaceX launched 120 Starlink satellites in 2019 and could launch many more in 2020. A competitor, OneWeb, could send more of its satellites to orbit in the coming year, too. These companies are blazing the trail for orbital internet — a business that Amazon and Apple are also pursuing — and upsetting astronomers, who fear that large constellations of internet satellites will imperil scientific study of the solar system and stars. A comet exits the solar system In September, a comet called Borisov 2I was spotted in our solar system, only the second ever confirmed interstellar object. Unlike Oumuamua, which was spotted in 2017 only as it was leaving the solar system, astronomers caught sight of Borisov and its 100,000-mile-long tail as it flew toward the sun, before it turned and began its exit. In 2020, scientists will continue to point ground and orbiting telescopes at Borisov as it speeds back toward the stars beyond — unless, as some astronomers hope, it explodes into fragments after being heated by the sun. Whatever happens, other interstellar visitors are sure to follow, and professional sky gazers hope to find them with powerful new telescopes in the years ahead. Bits of giant space rocks return to Earth Japan’s Hayabusa2 spacecraft concluded several close encounters with Ryugu, a near-Earth asteroid, last year. It twice collected samples from Ryugu’s surface, the second time after dropping what amounted to a bomb on the space rock’s surface. At the end of 2019, the probe began its trip home. Near the end of this year, it will try to jettison its samples back to Earth’s surface, in the Australian outback. Scientists hope to study the material for clues from the solar system’s early days. Hayabusa2 wasn’t the only spacecraft circling a space rock. NASA’s Osiris-Rex spent the year completing a close survey of Bennu, a different, boulder-strewn asteroid. The mission’s managers selected a site called Nightingale for a specimen-collection operation that they plan to carry out in August. That spacecraft will return its cargo to Earth in 2023. The moon gets another visitor China started 2019 by landing on the lunar far side, an accomplishment never before attempted by any of the world’s space agencies. That was the good news. In April, another potential lunar lander — Beresheet, built by an Israeli nonprofit — crashed on the moon’s surface. And in September, Vikram, a lander built by India’s space agency, crashed near the lunar South Pole. Before the end of 2020, the moon could see one more visitor from Earth. Chang’e-5, a robotic probe built by China, aims to collect moon rock and soil samples and send them back to Earth. The last set of lunar samples was gathered in 1976 by a Soviet spacecraft. The year to come may also bring greater clarity about American designs for returning to the moon. NASA is aiming to put the first woman and the next man on the moon by 2024, with a program called Artemis. A wide range of political, budgetary and technological hurdles stand in the way of meeting that ambitious timeline.

      "original_text": "TOKYO — Daisuke Hayakawa is the coach of Japan’s Olympic skateboarding team, which is likely to dominate the sport when it makes its debut at this summer’s Olympics in Tokyo. But that does not mean he would dare set his skateboard down on a city sidewalk. He may be a rebel in Japan, but he has manners. “Skateboarding became one of the sports at the Olympics, but the image of skateboarding in Japan is that it’s an activity for unruly kids,” he said. So as evening fell on a warm summer day last year, Hayakawa, 45, carried his board in the crook of his wrist. He left home in central Tokyo and took the subway to Kanegafuchi Station, a half-hour train ride north of downtown, and walked about 15 minutes toward the Sumida River. The streets and sidewalks were mostly empty. Yet his skateboard still never touched the ground. It was not until he had reached a broad and lonely concrete path near the river, under a thrumming highway viaduct near a homeless encampment, that Hayakawa set the board on its wheels. Skating alone, he practiced a range of ollies and flips, mostly leaping as his board spun beneath him, the kind of tricks his Olympic athletes will do in front of millions next summer. Across the river was a manicured park, acres of green grass etched with a tangle of smooth sidewalks. There were scintillating curbs and sets of concrete stairs lined by steel railings. There were benches where people sat. It would have been a perfect playground for skateboarders. But it was a tease, a mirage. Hayakawa would not dare. “I can’t skate over there,” he said with a shrug. “That would bother people.” Japan adheres to strict, unwritten rules of comportment. It is a culture of courtesies and public reserve — a land of order, where people line up to board subways, where they rarely eat or drink in public, where trash and graffiti are virtually absent. Dignity comes from blending in, not standing out. That explains the swarms of office workers in matching white shirts and the signs on public transportation politely requesting that those with headphones keep the music down, lest a muffled drumbeat disrupt another commuter’s quiet. Business cards are exchanged with two hands in a gesture of humility. Simple goodbyes become a dance of bowing and nodding in an exercise of demure grace. Skateboarding is none of that. It is disruptive, noisy, messy. That is the main reason it has, for decades, been relegated to the unkempt shadows of Japanese society — far more hidden and distrusted than in other places around the globe. “Here, no one uses skateboards for transportation — you can’t,” said Shimon Iwazawa, 20. He is known to eschew cultural norms and local ordinances by doing it anyway, but usually only in the dark of night. “If you skate in the street, it means you’re from a bad place. It’s a bad image.” Those perceptions can have consequences. On a Sunday last summer, Iwazawa said, he was carrying his skateboard through Tokyo Station when a security officer stopped him and demanded to see inside his backpack. It happens regularly, he and other skateboarders said. But this time, Iwazawa’s pack had a blade used to cut grip tape, the sticky sandpaper-like sheets skateboarders put on their decks to give their feet a grip on the board. The blade was confiscated as a weapon, Iwazawa said, and he was photographed, fingerprinted and held for several hours. Some skaters conceal their boards in bags to avoid judgment in public. They say they are used to being chastised by the elderly, especially, and by security guards. Sometimes they are called “Yankees,” an insult to what is perceived as boorish behavior. “That’s the struggle of the skateboarder here,” said Nino Moscardi, the team manager for Nike’s skateboard business in Japan. He sat at Streamer Coffee, a Shibuya shop with a skateboard theme, under skateboards commissioned as artwork. “People shout, ‘You should be doing that in the skateparks!’ And that’s a complete misunderstanding of skateboarding.” It was like that for a time in the United States, too. Skateboarding once was part of the counterculture, a haven for misfit kids, backed by soundtracks of punk and rap. Skateparks were built, usually out of sight, to keep the chaos off the streets. Over the decades, like so many other anti-authority movements, skateboarding leaked into the mainstream. Skateboards — a mode of transportation, an instrument of art, a totem of defiance — now glide across American sidewalks, plazas and streets. These days, skateboarding style, fashion and culture have morphed into beacons for masses looking for calculated rebelliousness. That American export echoed around the world, like Levi’s and Hollywood movies, to places like Japan. It came secondhand through the mail, in VHS videos and worn skateboard magazines. It came in competitions and demonstrations, where the likes of a teenage Tony Hawk visited and showed how it was done. Decades later, the crowded streets of Tokyo are filled with the young and old wearing Thrasher T-shirts and Vans shoes. There are skate shops and a growing number of skateparks. One thing there is not: actual skateboarding on the streets and sidewalks. “You’d think the bigger that skateboarding gets in Japan, the more accepted and less restrictive it would be,” Moscardi said. “But it’s actually the opposite.” Signs prohibiting it are everywhere. Part of the reason is practical: Tokyo’s streets and sidewalks are crowded. But bicycles are welcome, often seen zigging through pedestrians. The main difference is that bikes are quiet. Skateboards grind and clatter. Skateboarding on the street is considered “meiwaku-koui” — bothersome behavior. And yet now comes an army of young Japanese, men and women, boys and girls, likely to win more medals than any country this summer in the first Olympic skateboarding competitions. They are brash only in their athletic talent. There will be two distinct events: “street,” with a manufactured assortment of rails, stairs and other citylike obstacles on which to perform tricks, and “park,” which is mostly a smooth bowl of mounds and banks, harking to the empty swimming pools of California that birthed skateboarding’s surf-like style. Already, Japanese riders like Yuto Horigome, Aori Nishimura and a group of tween girls are stars of the global competition circuit and rising heroes to many in Japan. Now, their anticipated success at the Olympics is thrusting skateboarding into the mainstream. It is giving the sport here an acceptance it never had, and maybe never wanted. Skateparks are being built, especially in the suburbs and smaller cities. Parents sign their children up for skateboard classes. They hire coaches. The skatepark has become a cousin of the climbing gym — confined and parent-approved. These cocoons are spawning some of the world’s top athletes just in time for the Olympics. Expectations are high. Hayakawa expects Japan to capture at least six of the sport’s 12 medals, including multiple golds. It is sure to be a strange but exciting time for Hayakawa and others of an older generation, the grown-up misfits most deeply connected to the culture of skateboarding in Japan. “For my old friends, we want to show that what we did was not wrong,” Hayakawa said. “For the newcomers, who come to skateboarding because of the Olympics, I explain that our culture is cool. We are why they are competing.” After an hour or so under the viaduct, the red sun swallowed by a distant skyline just starting to sparkle, Hayakawa glowed with sweat. He flipped his skateboard back into his hands and retreated all the way to the station. Then he rode the next train home, carrying his own set of wheels under his arm. “People gradually see skateboarding as a sport,” Hayakawa said. “But most people will not understand that the counterculture side is the real skateboarding.” Kantaro Suzuki contributed reporting.

      "original_text": "As Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union becomes a reality, some people are celebrating and others are mourning. But for most, it seems, it is a time for recuperation and healing. LONDON — When Britain leaves the European Union at 11 p.m. on Friday, some will be celebrating and others will be mourning. But for most people interviewed this week around the country, it seems to mark a time for recovery — from years of wrangling that has upended the political system and sometimes strained the country’s social fabric. “It’s just been day after day of dysfunction, division and economic uncertainty. I’m not sure how we are supposed to bounce back from this,” said Andrew Fielden, a 39-year-old London-based accountant who supported Britain remaining in the European Union. “The irony is that Brexit was all about taking back control, but we’ve never been so out of control. No one even knows what the reality of Brexit will look like.” Since the 2016 referendum on Britain’s membership of the union, political discord has rippled through the country, sundering towns and cities and rupturing relationships among families and friends. The atmosphere became so toxic that in December’s general election, many Britons crossed traditional political divides to deliver the Conservative government a substantial mandate to “get Brexit done.” “Voting in the election was one of the hardest decisions of my life,” said Madeline Shaw, 42, a social worker from the southern port city of Southampton. She said she had almost always voted for the opposition Labour Party, but switched to the Conservatives this year because they promised to deliver Brexit. “We’ve made a spectacle of ourselves squabbling over Brexit for years. We’ve let down vulnerable communities, whose needs have been neglected because the government was paralyzed by Brexit,” Ms. Shaw said. “We had to move forward before the damage caused became irreparable.” Nothing has divided Britain quite like the question of Brexit. Those in favor are adamant that cutting financial and legal ties with the European Union and taking back control of immigration will allow Britain to reclaim its sovereignty and prosper. Those who want to remain feel an impending sense of loss at the prospect of being excluded from the bloc, its economic benefits and influence in the rest of the world. The tension between the two camps is visible in the port town of Boston on the east coast of England, which has both Britain’s highest proportion of Eastern European immigrants and one of its largest majorities for Brexit. Around 13 percent of the town’s 65,000 people were born elsewhere in Europe, according to the 2011 census, and Boston’s European population has continued to grow over subsequent years. “This isn’t about racism or discrimination against foreigners,” said Martin Lewis, a retired teacher from the town. “We welcome different nationalities and cultures in England, but the number we have absorbed is out of control. There aren’t enough jobs, houses and services to accommodate these people.” A Polish handyman from the town, who did not give his name for fear of damaging his business, said that many of the anxieties Boston residents had over immigration were inflated and not representative of reality. “We do the work they do not want to do, we live 10 people to one house, we earn our way of life and we do not burden anybody,” he said, adding that while he felt welcome in the town he was aware of hostile comments about the Polish community made “behind closed doors.” Boston residents were reluctant to talk about Brexit on a recent cold and rainy day — “There’s more to this town, there’s more to this country” one pensioner said. But reflecting on the past three and a half years, many of them said that the “Remain” movement’s reluctance to honor the result of the 2016 Brexit referendum felt like the biggest threat to the country’s democracy. “I do worry about the divides that have arisen from Brexit, but I fear that we would have seen unrest if the Brexit decision had been reversed,” Mr. Lewis said. Young Britons, who see Brexit as a major threat to their future, criticize older generations for being out of touch with their needs as the terms of the country’s relationship with its European neighbors are hammered out. “I am concerned about the people who carry the perspective that as long as issues of the country aren’t harming them personally, they can remain uninformed and uninvolved,” said Eden Reyhanian, an 18-year-old student at a school in North London. “Events within politics have made me feel as the likelihood of cohesion within our country is out of the picture, and while our nation is ideally supposed to become more unified when faced with threats of division, the opposite has occurred.” Oscar Redgrave, a 17-year-old student in Shrewsbury, Western England, who started a pro-European Union campaign group for young people, said one of the most worrying aspects of Brexit was how it had pushed racism and discrimination into the mainstream. “As we’ve become more divided on the subject of immigration, racism and hate crimes have become normalized, and British society has become more closed-minded,” he said. “It’s very disturbing.” But Mr. Redgrave is still hopeful that Brexit might be one day be reversed. He hopes for an overhaul of Britain’s electoral system, which critics say favors larger political parties. “Most young people are really for Europe,” he said. “If we get a voting system that allows us to really vote for who we want then I can see a scenario where we are back in Europe in five to 10 years. It’s possible.” PHOTOS: Left, Eden Reyhanian, an 18-year-old high school student from North London.

      "original_text": "Golf was restored to the Games, in part, to forge an association with stars like Woods. But with a few months left to qualify, he is on the outside looking in. In November 2008, two officials from the International Golf Federation traveled to Switzerland to make a case for returning their sport’s athletes to the Olympics after a century-long hiatus. But as the men made their presentation to members of the International Olympic Committee, they quickly realized they were pitching to an audience fixated on a single player. Never mind the sport’s global reach or its charitable impact and cornerstone values of honesty and fair play. To Ty Votaw, who was helping make golf’s case for inclusion, it was clear from the start what the I.O.C. considered golf’s greatest asset. “The very first question asked was, ‘Will Tiger Woods play?’” Votaw said. Twelve years later, the Olympics still covet Woods — now, perhaps, more than ever. The problem is that there may not be a spot for him. In 2008, Woods’s participation seemed foreordained. He stood alongside Usain Bolt and Michael Phelps as one of the world’s most dominant athletes, and was coming off a season that had included his 14th major title. For the 10th time in 11 years, he ended the year ranked No. 1. Woods, with his star power, and the Olympics, with their global stage, looked like a marriage brokered in a corporate boardroom. Yet while Woods’s spirit was willing, a back injury sidelined him for most of 2016, sinking his hopes of qualifying for that summer’s competition in Rio de Janeiro. Golf returned to the Games without him, and the Englishman Justin Rose won the gold medal. Now, four years later, Woods is the closest he has been to the Olympics since he attended an archery event at the 1984 Games in Los Angeles with his father. To qualify, he must be one of the top four American players ranked inside the world top 15 as of June 22. Woods is currently seventh in the world, but he is only the fifth-best American heading into this week’s Farmers Insurance Open at Torrey Pines in San Diego. At the moment, Brooks Koepka, Justin Thomas, Dustin Johnson and Patrick Cantlay hold the four Olympic tournament places reserved for Americans. Woods, 44, spoke last fall of his desire to participate in the Tokyo Games, describing it as a “once-in-a-lifetime experience.” “And especially at the age I’ll be, I don’t know if I have many more chances,” he said. It may comfort Woods that in the post-World War II era, two United States Olympians, the sailors Paul Smart in 1948 and Everard Endt in 1952, have won gold medals in their 50s. So it’s not necessarily now or never for him. But for an Olympic movement ravaged by the cancers of corruption and cheating, and reeling from the retirements of Bolt and Phelps, there would be no time like the present to plug into Woods’s transcendence. “I know TV companies for obvious reasons are excited about it,” said Peter Dawson, the International Golf Federation’s president. So, it would appear, is the host country. In October, roughly 60 miles from the Olympic venue, Japanese fans cheered louder for Woods than they did their native son, Hideki Matsuyama, at the inaugural Zozo Championship, which Woods won wire to wire. Yes, Woods is currently the odd man out among Americans. But that is, as Dawson joked, “nothing that another Masters win wouldn’t cure.” In 2016, the top four men in line to headline the Olympic field — Jason Day, Jordan Spieth, Rory McIlroy and Johnson — chose not to compete for reasons that included the fear of contracting the mosquito-borne Zika virus. This year, it’s possible an American player or two could be sidelined by something else: money. The men’s competition in Tokyo will take place two weeks after the British Open and two weeks before the start of the three-tournament FedEx Cup playoffs, which offer a $60 million total purse, including a $15 million payoff to the eventual winner. The first playoff event is outside Boston, 14 time zones from Tokyo, and so it is not unthinkable that a top player, prioritizing majors over medals or playoff riches over Olympic gold, might decide that it’s not worth making the round-the-world journey to Japan at such a key moment in his season. Could somebody also stay home because of outside pressure to step aside to make room for Woods? “There may be some of that,” Dawson said, though he quickly added, “I’m sure Tiger wouldn’t want to get into the Games that way.” It has happened before, though. At the 2004 Australian swimming trials, the superstar Ian Thorpe, the world-record holder and reigning Olympic champion in the 400-meter freestyle, was disqualified from his heat for a false start after he lost his balance on the blocks and fell into the water. The top two finishers in the final qualified for the Athens Games, and scores of Australians soon were publicly calling on Craig Stevens, the runner-up, to relinquish his spot to Thorpe. There was no danger that Stevens or Thorpe would miss the Games; both had qualified in other events. But a month later, during a televised interview for which he was paid a six-figure sum, Stevens announced that he was ceding his spot in the 400 freestyle to Thorpe, who went on to successfully defend his Olympic title. For the moment, Woods still controls his fate. After his victory last year at the Masters, he described the Olympics as “a big goal,” but he admitted “getting there and making the team is going to be the tough part.” One option, Woods acknowledged, was that he might have to play more than he would like in the first half of 2020 in the pursuit of Olympic qualifying points. A strong finish this week, at an event he has won seven times, would be a great start. “I just know that if I play well in the big events like I did this year,” Woods said last year, “things will take care of itself.” PHOTO (PHOTOGRAPH BY TANNEN MAURY/EPA, VIA SHUTTERSTOCK) https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/20/sports/20tiger-bag/merlin_165820458_5ebf50b9-65b4-4dca-89c3-8ce0a2c87384-articleLarge.jpg https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/20/sports/20tiger-bag/merlin_165820458_5ebf50b9-65b4-4dca-89c3-8ce0a2c87384-jumbo.jpg https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/20/sports/20tiger-bag/merlin_165820458_5ebf50b9-65b4-4dca-89c3-8ce0a2c87384-superJumbo.jpg https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/20/sports/20tiger-bag/20tiger-bag-thumbStandard.jpg https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/20/sports/20tiger-bag/20tiger-bag-filmstrip.jpg https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/20/sports/20tiger-bag/20tiger-bag-sfSpan.jpg https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/20/sports/20tiger-bag/20tiger-bag-thumbWide.jpg https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/20/sports/20tiger-bag/merlin_165820458_5ebf50b9-65b4-4dca-89c3-8ce0a2c87384-articleInline.jpg https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/20/sports/20tiger-bag/20tiger-bag-facebookJumbo.jpg Woods is no stranger to international competition, having played in the Ryder Cup and the Presidents Cup.
